I was friend with one for 20 years. When he hit his little chihuahua that was it for me... I dont know how many years its been cause i never looked back, but i guess 5, 6 years..if you are in the same place i were i have only 1 advice. Gather all your family and friends and just go on the day. Psychos use humans for their entertainment, cause they are bored very easily. Another sign if you are unsure if he or she is a psycho, if you cry and they look at your lips, not your eyes, Then She/He is a Psychopath..","Its very easy to oversee some of all the other great performances when you have such a massive bunch of new and old talent.👏🏻 Butler played a very believable psychopath.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One love) There is one question I'd really love to ask (One heart) Is there a place for the hopeless sinner Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?

""Let's get together and feel all right."" One more thing Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon (One love) So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom (One song) Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation Sayin', ""One love, one heart Let's get together and feel all right."" I'm pleading to mankind (One love) Oh, Lord (One heart) Whoa. ""Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right."" Let's get together and feel all right. ""Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right."" Let's get together and feel all right.

"aDyQxtg0V2w","Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the idea of American exceptionalism—especially the belief that Americans would somehow be uniquely resistant to authoritarianism. Films like Civil War by Alex Garland tap into that myth. They portray bold uprisings, states breaking away in defiance, people rising up en masse to fight tyranny. But honestly, I’m not convinced that’s how things would really go.

When I look at the political climate in the U.S. now, especially with the return of figures like Donald Trump who’ve shown clear authoritarian tendencies, what I see isn’t widespread resistance—it’s resignation. A lot of people just seem to be keeping their heads down, hoping things will pass. There’s a real sense of fear, weariness, and even helplessness. The courts, the media, the institutions that are supposed to hold things in check—they often seem either overwhelmed or complicit. That doesn’t lead to rebellion; it leads to quiet compliance.

And this idea that Americans are somehow fundamentally different from people in other countries? That they’ll always stand up for liberty while others cower? That just doesn’t hold water. People everywhere are people. When faced with fear, most will try to protect their families, avoid trouble, and wait things out. It’s not necessarily cowardice—it’s just a survival instinct.

Revolutions, historically, don’t always come from noble courage in the face of tyranny. They come when people have no other option, or when a critical mass sees an opening. But most of the time, especially in the early stages of authoritarianism, people try to adapt. They rationalize, they withdraw, they stay quiet.

So while Civil War might capture the emotional intensity of a fractured America, I don’t think it reflects the reality of how resistance plays out. If things keep sliding further, I suspect the reaction won’t be some dramatic uprising—but more likely a slow, uncertain acquiescence. And that’s what I find really chilling.","Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the idea of American exceptionalism—especially the belief that Americans would somehow be uniquely resistant to authoritarianism.

Also was so great seeing Johnny Cash bought back to life as I love his music to. A big fan from NewZealand and both artists music will live on forever. I sang through the whole movie according to my partner and I don't do that alot.","Best  movie I've seen in a decade and I know as im 56 and remember this time even if I was only a baby when he started out and artists today do not have the right mindset like he does and is why he is still going and keeping it real is what he did best .

"FdV-Cs5o8mc","TRIVIA: During auditions, Monaco Barbero revealed that her favorite Bob Dylan song was “I Won’t Back Down.”
As shown in the movie, country legend Johnny Cash spent time at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival training for an upcoming celebrity demolition derby. Cash ended up placing second to Pope Paul VI.
The United States theatrical release did not include the scene that shows Alan Lomax breaking his right pinkie while attempting to rip off Mike Bloomfield’s whammy bar. The scene was shown in Botswanan theaters.
When Bob Dylan appeared on “MTV Unplugged,” the network hired retired Special Operations personnel to keep electrical instruments off the premises. No whammy bar related injuries were reported.
No Byrds were harmed in the making of this movie.
This movie was dedicated to Luke Perry.
GOOFS: Bob Dylan, who is right-handed, is shown using a left-handed typewriter.
At a Hootenanny, Pete Seeger sings “Old Time Rock And Roll.”
RECEPTION: Bob Dylan’s former co-workers at the carnival generally like the movie.","TRIVIA: During auditions, Monaco Barbero revealed that her favorite Bob Dylan song was “I Won’t Back Down.”

"FdV-Cs5o8mc","Saw the movie today on Hulu.  Actually surprised it went to stream so quickly and for free.  The beginning was a little rough and hard to draw my attention.  I didn’t see what all the hype was about for either the movie or Chalamet but more towards the middle, I got drawn in, mainly to the story and life of  Bob Dylan and Chalmet’s acting improved.  I can’t tell where he gained 20 pounds except maybe his face but he really didn’t need to gain any weight because at same age, Dylan was just as skinny.  You love the story but horrible how Dylan rotated women like we rotate our outfits.  He even took Joan to Sylvie’s apartment the first time.  But the ending was good.  Basically form your own path.  He can’t forget folk music did give him his start and everyone involved who let him in door and for some people that’s what they wanted.  I’m glad he gave Newport at least one folk song.  This movie is along the lines of 1979’s The Rose.  Not same story but about a musician.  If you’ve never seen that movie, I would recommend.  For people who didn’t know Bob Dylan, good movie.  It would have been a fun movie to be cast in, different time era and especially for Chalamet to sing, play guitar and see what being a superstar is all about.  But I wasn’t “wowed” like everyone else.  Almost anyone could play that part and he was given 5 years to learn guitar, sing, figure out voice and study Bob Dylan.  Not to mention he does appear to be instrument and language inclined as he learned piano for another movie and did study at a prestigious arts high school (advantage). Thousands of dollars not gone to waste.  It’s one of those movies you should see at least once.  I thought Elle Fanning did a great job in her role which no one talks about and Joan Baez sang great.  At least toward the end, finally Chalamet and Fanning had some on screen chemistry.  Chalamet struggles with on screen chemistry except for a select few that I think he wants to date in real life.  I didn’t realize Sylvie was portraying Suze.  For his first serious 4 year relationship, the movie didn’t really portray it that way.  I never saw at the end if Chalamet gave Woody back his harmonica or not. Before this movie, I didn’t know “folk music” was about social justice.  I thought it was just another music genre.","Saw the movie today on Hulu.  Actually surprised it went to stream so quickly and for free.

"lmN1Op8ygno","Low and behold, it’s already 1 year old!!!

The filmmakers manage to make the movie stand on its own terms without blatantly resembling the original 
There's minor callbacks here and there but it's really about this young woman dealing with her possible hysteria interfering with her godly duties 
Nell Tiger Free gives a fantastic, gut-wrenching performance being appropriately conflicted There's a heavy dose of atmosphere, gnarly-looking visuals, and some truly memorable sequences adding to the grotesque body horror 
It's incredible that Stevenson was able to pull off as much as she did particularly with one scene so graphic she avoided an NC-17 rating And when they do explain the reasoning for this unholy birth taking place it totally turns everything around 
To them this rising of the son of the devil might be the answer to send the ignorant back to their faith, making change without resorting to violence, erase the need for secularism wiping the slate clean as it were, how do we control people who no longer believe (by creating something to fear) 
There's also subtle comments and motifs on women's reproductive rights and bodily autonomy in the name of the holy word being quite contemporary 
The first film is superior in many ways and this does take a while to get going being 2 hours but I'm so thankful this one created a very good bridge to what was established prior while still being an effective religious horror tale 
Maybe more 'Omen' films are on the way that can bring back some staying power to a nearly 50 year old franchise","Low and behold, it’s already 1 year old!!!

It’s not even film school ya need to learn that in. lol. That cop scene,  a 5 yr old wouldn’t film that dumb of scene. He would see the killer too not just us fans. Few scenes like that. Now the “Chapter 1” movie. She flips on lighter and only 2 ft of lit area yet they don’t see the “doll face” killer? She is right there. lol. That scare were fans see the killer and people in movie don’t. Never seen it done so bad as done in these 2 movies.  Just terrible Dir/filming. The Henderson/Pullman movie good been good if didn’t do that like 5 diff times and few other things also. Like always leaving each other alone nonstop. 😊 “You wait here”. Good movie ruined by some stuff we already know not to do in horror movies by 7 yrs old. Both sequels just more of creepy 1980s music videos. Just hit the girl over the head with rifle.

"0NLDbLsC56g","Lyrics 🎤🎶

[Verse 1: Shaboozey]
Living on the edge and finding out it's kinda dull
Realize I am somebody that I don't know at all
Oh God, would you tell me why I'm worn down to the bone?
Even though I've only seen half of the world, I'm coming home

[Verse 2: Shaboozey]
Hanging on to hope, I'm losing grip of time and space
Mind is running circles over something I can't change
I've loved, I've tried, no one told me when in Rome
Am I feeling all the feelings or am I just going numb?

[Chorus: Shaboozey]
Oh me, oh my, would you look in my eyes?
We laugh or cry just to feel alive
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
No time for living a lie
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Time flies, so don't blink twice
Time flies, so don't blink twice

[Verse 3: Myles Smith]

I've been tryna catch my breath since I was seventeen
I've hurt, I've cried, had way too much to drink
But I won't let my life drown in that old kitchen sink

"SXcCdQdcBtw","This is probably one of the worse anime movies I have seen! Most of the damn movie was a recap! Who recaps for 45 minutes to an hour. Just as I thought the movie was gonna pick up and get really good it was over. It sucks because the first demon slayer movie was excellent. This move just seems like they wanted money. The only good fight scenes was from the recap. This movies sucked and I am for sure not going to see another demon slayer movie after this garbage. I can wait for Hulu or one of the streaming companies to get it. 
It's hard to see that people have given this movie good reviews. Any movie with a 45 minute to an hour recap is trying to fill the gap they couldn't fill. This shouldn't of been a movie and they know that. When they actually start the movie so much time has passed so they pretty much just talk heal and go to training. There wasn't enough to put into the movie so they recapped most of the movie.

Oh and the dumbest part of the whole movie is that nezuko is a sun god now! Just poof the sun don't hurt her. Now since I have seen the show I know wtf is going on for everyone else this part is so dumb. While recapping for an hour you didn't think you should fill in the back on that as well. I mean it's only an hour recap lol.

Part 2 of the movie let's recap the first movie for an hour and then train for 30 minutes over done. I saved you all money and now you don't need to see part 2!!!

On a side note people are like it's amazing to see in theaters. First off with how cheap a TV for ""60 is it's pretty hard to see going to a theater being better. Next they are like the sound. This is what happens when your theater room in your house has them small speakers or just has a sound bar....maybe invest in some good quality sound. Our movies at my place sound almost better than theaters.

LOL, people who are saying the trailer points out it is a recap. Nothing in the trailer says it is a recap the whole movie. It for sure trick you to think they are making a new movie. He also indicates this is for the fans......I think that was a typo I think that was supposed to say money. Either way the official trailer for sure makes it look like a new movie and not a recap. I shouldn't have to go read about it to find this out the trailer should show me but it doesn't. So to have people giving it 1 star makes 100% sense only them demon slayer nerds would know as they research it like it's something important.

I know I said it once but the animation is just like it is on the show and when you have a budget like them anyone can make it look that good. 

P.S.

Everyone that is like the animation is amazing and can't be beat. First off they have such a high budget that any anime movie with a budget like this will look amazing. Lastly the whole thing looked no different from the episode are people seeing stuff I am not seeing? To me it sounds like this show has a lot of fans that like to kiss a$$. Tbh I hate the maker of this bc it is clear he just did this for money and not the fans as you can clearly see he maybe spent an hour making this movie as most of it is a recap. Demon slayer lost a lot of respect from me due to this movie.","This is probably one of the worse anime movies I have seen! Most of the damn movie was a recap! Who recaps for 45 minutes to an hour.

It's about as straightforward as you'd expect

There's lots of stuff in here about redemption and humility
Maybe would've worked better as a tv flick but as it is the film is a decent underdog story to say the least","1 year old!

"iAt_j6zEeF0","We hate most movies these days. Many faith based movies are cringe or poor acting. Some are purposefully a wolf in sheep's clothing so we just dont watch many movies and few faith movies, BUT THIS!!!! This movie was inspired by God! The acting was great! Cast was great!  The story was outstanding! The message was long over due and done properly. This and The War Room are movies needed. No red flags. No cring moments or poor acting! Some very astounding acting scenes by many. Some scenes are not easy to pull off but they pulled them off flawlessly. You forget you are watching a movie because the acting is well done.

I hope these ppl make another one. The War Room, The Forge......God is Not Dead series...Risen....Abt 3 Kevin Sorbo movies...Those are worth having before others....but, be clear,The Forge is profoundly well done.

What a crazy story and insane circumstances to fall in love. She is so used to having to give something up to receive love. Igor giving her the ring without expecting anything in return she is programmed to be transactional and automatically tries to give him sex for the ring. But when he tries to kiss her and be intimate you can see her resistance to actually being in love (Igor and Anora). Last scene is her finally being vulnerable with a man and letting herself be loved as Anora not Ani. Made me cry and laugh, great film.","What a great film.

You don’t have to be a sex worker to relate to the feeling of people wanting to trash you and make you feel like trash because you don’t have or come from where they come from. 

In my life, I don’t have a big, full family. My chosen family was my life. My ex, flipped the switch on me, going so far as to pretend he didn’t know me in public. 

He might as well burned me alive. Sounds dramatic. But when you believe in and are invested in your life to the extent I was- you can’t help but feel that pain- 

I wish I had someone hold and hug me through this low era of my life. I just feel like life has been generally hard. Tired of that.

"15q3yBd_HRs","I saw an review which had an interesting take on the final scene.  When Igor gave Anora the ring, her ""gratitude"" manifested itself by her reverting to what she knew best which was sex as a job with no emotional involvement.  When Igor, who clearly had developed admiration and feelings for her, wanted something more than passionless sex by rote and tried to kiss her, she, still in her ""job"" mode instinctively pulled away.  But then, maybe she realized that Igor was ""safe"", she let him pull her into his arms and all of the anger, feelings of loss and sheer grief came flooding out. What this means for the two of them, the director left to the imagination of the audience.  Much as the possibility of Anora and Igor becoming a thing is intriguing, it probably can't happen. Maybe the experience has changed both of them but Anora likely has more trust issues than ever and Igor is a spoke in the Russian mob wheel and you don't walk away from that in one piece, especially since Ivan's mother might look for any excuse to order a hit on Anora.  My own opinion?  The is one great f-ing movie, Mikey Madison more than deserved her Oscar and it was wonderful that Yura Borisov's excellent and very nuanced work was recognized with a nomination,","I saw an review which had an interesting take on the final scene.

Due to 100% lessaiz fair capitalism on the borderlands, you're either rich, or you die by the way side. There is no state. There is no police. There is no constitution. There's no rights or laws; there's only money, and weapons. You make hard cash or nobody gives a fuck.  I got nothing from that in the trailer.

And the king of the jungle, the richest guy with the biggest weapon, who's in the process of building a de facto dictatorship, with nothing but power he got through drones, money, & artillery, choiling in a spaceship floating above all & sending down drones when something doesn't go his way - Handsom Jack, the best character of them all, is missing.","What I liked about borderlands that it was hard-core SCI FI the way you'd imagine it to look like in a tough environment with hard to deal with aliens yet with incredibly powerful weapons.

Issues with it.  
They are a Christian family and yet nobody has prayed or seen a Bible yet. 
And I think Carmen came across as a major heel!! This family of .7-8? Uprooted their family and moved from Australia to Nashville based on Carmen’s word, and he basically screws them over!! And the head of his record lane also does.  And that Degarmo
And Key phone call made Degarmo look like a real jerk!!
I love the family and Mrs Smallbone is an amazing person. But man, 2 major Christian artists look like real bad.  In my opinion.  
I absolutely love King and country","I’m 32 minutes in and having some
