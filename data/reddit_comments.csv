The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,1,"Maybe it's just me but if you hadn't told me it was Pedro Pascal, I don't think I would have known. He disappeared into his voice work the way that other non-voice actors don't seem to be capable of doing."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,2,"I liked that there were only brief hints to tell you the type of world the movie existed in.

Didn't feel strictly post apocalyptic per se but seeing the whales swimming over a submerged Golden Gate Bridge was a great visual to tell you that it's no longer the world we're used to.  

They didn't throw a lot of background at you and it wasn't relevant to the story but those little snippets of information told you an entire picture."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,3,"If you have kids, please find a way to get to this one this weekend.




If you don't have kids, please find a way to get to this one this weekend.


A special film. Special, special film."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,4,The crow getting decapitated was insane
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,5,"One of those rare times when the credits rolled where I just sat there in awe and felt so many things. Gorgeous animation, fantastic score, and a heartwarming story about family. Those that you choose and those that choose you.

The moment on the ship where Roz reassures Brightbill that everything will be okay after the bad news she was just told perfectly encapsulates her growth into becoming a mother. Maaaan. This one will stick with me."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,6,"""As a mother of seven children..."" \*animal snarls, baby possum screams* ""of six children...""

Please tell me I'm not the only sick fuck who laughed at that part, because I was certainly the only person in my showing that did."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,7,‚ÄúBut you can call me Roz‚Äù cue my heart breaking for the 5th time üò≠
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,8,"A modern-day classic, I was on the verge of tears multiple times throughout."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,9,"During the scene when Roz runs with Brightbill on her shoulder once he is ready to fly with the rest of the goslings, my dad and I started crying and we reached over and hugged saying we loved each other.


This was the best movie I've ever seen in my life."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,10,"I read this book to my 6th grade English classes every year, doing voices for the different characters. It was always a favorite of theirs and mine, so I've been so looking forward to this movie. It did not disappoint. I choked up every single time I read certain sections of the book to my kids and I spent the last 30 minutes of the movie in or on the verge of tears as predicted. Very dark sense of humor but tons of heart. Fantastic animation. Lots of changes from the book, which actually made it more interesting to watch for someone who has read it a dozen times. There are 3 books in the series, and all of them are great, so I really hope this gets sequels like How to Train Your Dragon.¬†


Call your mother.¬†"
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,11,Did they ever follow up on the green fluid that the fox saw her leaking?
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,12,"This is one of my favorite animated movies ever now.

I couldn't believe how incredible this was.

It touched on so many facets of life that were not original concepts by any means, but absolutely done in the best ways possible. 

Life, death, love, loneliness.  I think you could easily make a case that Roz was a stand-in for an autistic child just trying to learn how to make friends and understand the world.  Moving on, finding yourself. 

Just...ugh give this movie all the awards."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,13,"It's like it was designed to be a tech demo. Roz is unbeliably fluid and dynamic throughout this entire film. That + the artstyle is quite mesmerizing. This movie is also just incredibly cute and endearing. 



Would recommend"
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,14,"There's a lot to admire about the film, but I want to give a shout-out to Kris Bowers' score.

This is one of the best scores for an animated film in the past years. It's simply marvelous."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,15,"There wasn't a dry eye in the theater at this one, great movie! Was not expecting it to be so moving"
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,16,I was shocked at how much I cried during this movie. It was like the second half of the movie hit and the waterworks didn't stop. What an incredible movie.
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,17,"I confess...when the Fox was saying you're my only friend, what if I need you, what if I have a question? It made me cry. Pascal's delivery and the sheer sorrow in his voice. And feeling somewhat disconnected from friends in my 30s, missing more time and closeness. Thinking of a couple I need to call. It really got to me. 

But I also loved that Fink the Fox was finally vulnerable."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,18,"This generation's Iron Giant.
Gorgeous animation. Touching story.
A score that gave me goosebumps at times.
Its also surprisingly violent; feels like they took full advantage of the fact that they were aiming for a PG rating, and were not scared of creating a little childhood trauma along the way."
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,19,Very sweet film. I kept getting thrown off by Pedro Pascal‚Äôs character because I kept thinking he was the Fox from Zootopia. The Fox character in this film was more vulnerable than the one in Zootopia.
The Wild Robot,1fqd0b1,20,"I am the mom of a kiddo with some social/emotional and physical challenges, who felt called to be a mom despite feeling ill-equipped for it some days. I think this movie broke me. I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it. Never thought I would relate to a robot and a goose so much. 10/10"
Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle,NA,NA,No comments found
Anora,1jr0qw5,1,"I hadn‚Äôt thought about this movie in years and yet it has lived rent-free in my mind since I was 13. This may have been the movie to teach me about tropes, really, the way that it so effectively uses all the familiar conspiracy thriller beats a la ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù got branded into my young mind. I was actually quite surprised to see when I looked it up on Letterboxd that people don‚Äôt like this movie. I rewatched it this week and, while obviously not perfect, I still got quite a nostalgic kick out of it. 

Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker, a truly early 2000s cast, not to mention Leslie Bibb who is currently having her White Lotus moment. It‚Äôs actually insane to think this was 25 years ago, she still looks fantastic. I also love that this movie is mostly about Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen beefing. You‚Äôve got Coach and the Manhunter himself pulling these strings and they just give me such great ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù vibes. 

As far as similar conspiracy thrillers go, maybe this isn‚Äôt the most unique one. But it is so specific to a time and place. I really loved the moment when the plethora of models walk into the Skulls party and Higher by Creed starts playing, and they basically play the song in full with lyrics. It‚Äôs no mystery why 13-year-old me latched onto this. Plus you‚Äôve got some Papa Roach, some Collective Soul, some Fatboy Slim. This just really takes me back to a simpler time. 

There‚Äôs definitely a fantasy element that probably played really well to me back then too. The fantasy of one day being accepted into the elites, all your money problems and unsure future plans suddenly secured. I loved the touch that when he‚Äôs taking money out of the ATM it says, ‚Äú$20,019.43‚Äù or something, implying that he wouldn‚Äôt even have been able to take out twenty dollars in the first place. Not just the fantasy of security, but also the idea that a 19-year-old could pull one over on a 200 year old secret society that has endless resources and surveillance. 

Overall, even knowing this is just a carbon copy of so many movies before it and since, this still hits for me. The soundtrack, the cast, the tropes, they just bring me right back. It‚Äôs a 7/10 for me. A movie above any other!"

Anora,1jr0qw5,3,"It's wild. I was randomly thinking about this film the other day. I only ever saw it once and like another redditors said its sort of been in the place of simultaneously something that I hardly think about but also which lives rent free in my mind.

I was thinking that they don't really make films like this anymore."
Anora,1jr0qw5,4,This movie is such a male power fantasy.
Anora,1jr0qw5,5,This movie lived on Starz when I was a kid. I watched it a million times just because it was the best thing on at midnight. I always wanted it to be better than it actually was though.
The Brutalist,1i37yra,1,I found this movie to be persuasive and intellectually stimulating.
The Brutalist,1i37yra,2,Everyone got that shit on. Immaculate clothing all around
The Brutalist,1i37yra,3,"That opening on the boat, what a great theater experience"
The Brutalist,1i37yra,4,"In a movie with a ton of great moments, the one that lingers in my mind is when Laszlo‚Äôs cousin kicks him out of the house and his face is constantly shrouded in shadow. Took my breath away first time I saw it."
The Brutalist,1i37yra,5,"I really love how the overall theme is the decay of a personal ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù 

Most of the time you see someone bastardize the American Dream. Not the other way around. 

To watch a person have their dreams eventually erode away was sadly compelling to watch. The rape scene, and Laszlo injecting his wife with heroin were incredibly disturbing/depressing, but also earned. Very well done film."
The Brutalist,1i37yra,6,I don't know what I was expecting but it definitely wasn't Adrien Brody getting a hand job from a prostitute before the opening credits had even rolled.
The Brutalist,1i37yra,7,"Some of the visuals in this movie are jaw dropping, even when the focus is still on the characters. That cut to Laszlo being surrounded by a crowd of the American elite when he's brought back to the house for the first time; the shot of the train; and The entire overture sequence are all just really mesmerizing moments.

Guy Pierce's performance also might be my favorite of the year."
The Brutalist,1i37yra,8,"Me, leaning over to my friend after the first hour: ‚Äúboy, Harrison sure has a man crush on Laszlo, doesn‚Äôt he?‚Äù

Me, two hours later: ‚Äú‚Ä¶oh‚Äù"
The Brutalist,1i37yra,9,Nothing rekindles the fire  in a marriage like H‚Ä¢E‚Ä¢R‚Ä¢O‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢N‚ù§Ô∏è
The Brutalist,1i37yra,10,I couldn't get over how much Zsofia looks like Daniel Radcliffe
The Brutalist,1i37yra,11,"Not once in this 3+ hrs-long movie did I feel bored. I appreciated the intermission but frankly I didn‚Äôt need it.

Can‚Äôt wait for Adrien Brody‚Äôs second Oscar!"
The Brutalist,1i37yra,12,"Just copy-pasting my comment from a different thread‚Ä¶  
  
The sequence leading into the intermission is some of the most spine-tingling filmmaking I‚Äôve ever seen. The voiceover of the letter interwoven with the newsreel footage about PA steel and its impact on American industrialism and ultimately imperialism COMBINED with the massive, booming score‚Ä¶beyond thrilling."
The Brutalist,1i37yra,13,"When the doors opened in the study, I felt the theater let out a collective gasp"
The Brutalist,1i37yra,14,"I have so many questions about so many things in the film, but the biggest one is: what was up with the final shot???"
The Brutalist,1i37yra,15,"For me it‚Äôs all in that last line:


*‚ÄùNo matter what the others try and sell you, it is the destination, not the journey.‚Äù*

Dude spends decades on one building only so he can get a handshake at a cocktail party."
The Brutalist,1i37yra,16,The moment where the Italian was leading them into the marble quarry felt eerily stripped straight from a Tarkovsky
The Brutalist,1i37yra,17,"I cannot believe that a three and a half hour long movie had better pacing than like, 90% of movies made nowadays. I was utterly impressed at how I was never bored for a single minute during this."
The Brutalist,1i37yra,18,One of the best cinema experiences I‚Äôve ever had. Part 1 is completely perfect. Part 2 is more complicated and harder to digest but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.
The Brutalist,1i37yra,19,Was anyone pleasantly surprised by how good Joe Alwyn was? He perfectly played the pompous rich son with rage issues when he doesn‚Äôt get his way
The Brutalist,1i37yra,20,This movie is not a bowling alley. I'll say that much.

A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,3,This is the second James Mangold biopic in which a tempestuous relationship is highlighted by having the two lovers perform a duet of It Ain‚Äôt Me Babe.
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,4,Best part was a stoned Johnny Cash showing up like a guardian angel to offer sage wisdom and bugles to our conflicted hero Bob Dylan.
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,5,Your music‚Äôs like an oil painting in a dentist office lmaooo
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,6,"Kinda funny but my friend, who knew little to nothing about Bob Dylan, was on edge throughout the film &amp; thought ‚Äúokay this is where he‚Äôs gonna die‚Äù at multiple points lmao  

Needless to say, dude was so shocked afterwards to learn Bob‚Äôs still alive"
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,7,"I will be interested to know what people new to Bob Dylan think about this movie. I had a Dylan phase in college, mostly the 60s period covered in this movie, so I kind of loved this. I watched an early screening and enjoyed it so much I went back to a preview today and liked it just as much. 

I think the movie does some interesting things here and there that may be flying over people's head. I say this mainly because I see people call it a ""standard biopic"" and I really don't think that's quite accurate. Sure it's not an art house take like I'm Not There, but it's definitely more interesting than Walk The Line.

First of all, this has an insane amount of music performances, in small venues, festivals, recording sessions, you name it. And can you blame them? The whole cast is incredible doing their own singing and playing the instruments live. Another thing is that I've seen comments saying the movie ""doesn't have an insight"" into Dylan, and I would disagree. There are quite a few scenes where he basically lays out his philosophy, like talking to Sylvie and saying the character from the movie ""made herself into what she wanted to be"" or that ""you have to be a freak"" to hold people's attention. Later, as he becomes famous, he writes to Johnny Cash that fame is making him ""paranoid."" We then see him displeased with his level of fame after the Newport'63 scene.  At every turn we see the people around him trying to sway him into the direction they want him to take, or how they want to use their connection to their benefit, and some even showing some hints of jealousy and resentment, including the scene where he says ""people wonder why the songs didn't come to them."" I thought those tidbits were very interesting without beating you over the head with it. I also appreciated how they didn't shy away from showing how he could be a bit of an asshole, Bob!

Anyhoo, as I said the cast is stacked from top to bottom. I watched an interview with Edward Norton on Colbert talking about how ""no one should play Dylan,"" but I'll be damned if Timothee Chalamet didn't freaking nail this. I particularly loved the restraint in the non-music parts of this. Don't need to comment on the music performances because they were stellar. The rest of the cast is just as fascinating. The performances really made this. Solid 4/5 for me."
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,8,"Every time I go into a Chalamet movie I think, oh god, this twerp again, and every time he floors me with how good he is. I love Dylan. Chalamet was spot on with so many of his mannerisms. It was amazingly good. The voice wasn‚Äôt exactly right all the time, it wasn‚Äôt an imitation, but so many little things about it were exact. Like, when he asks someone for a cigarette when someone‚Äôs talking to him, or the little under his breath comments, or the ‚Äúthis one‚Äôs a new one.‚Äù So good."

A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,14,I like the inclusion of the black girl interest he had for that five minute scene at the fancy party cause Dylan definitely had a thing for black girls in the 80s and it's cool we got to see that even though the timeline is all weird
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,15,Felt like it was more of a concert than a biopic but I enjoyed the performances
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,16,"I think after watching this movie I'm going to make my entire identity 'I like Bob Dylan'.

You know I've always liked him at an arms length but couldn't tell you much about his music or him in general but seriously I think this may change my Spotify algorithm for awhile. The guy has so many banger songs and what I really liked about this movie is that while it does stick to some traditional musical bio tropes, it's not a true biography film. We're never overly explained much about Dylan or his past, because no one knew much about him‚Äîthat's the point. He just came out of nowhere and wrote some of the most influential and incredible songs of all time. I love how the movie shows us his rise from obscurity to his initial fame and his change from folk to rock. Everything we need to know about him is in this film. I think complaining you knew less about him after watching like I've seen a few reviews do is disingenuous, not everything needs to be spoon fed to you. This movie transports you to the time when everyone was hearing these songs for the first time and it actually feels that way when watching it. It's basically just a concert movie and I kind of fucking love it for that. How else are you going to do a Bob Dylan film? 

This could've been a disaster and they landed the plane and it absolutely rocks for that. I don't know why but every time I hear Timothee Chalamet is going to be in a movie doing something I think he's going to be bad and he almost always proves me wrong, I'm done doubting the dude. This could've been him dong a terrible impression and it does feel 'impressiony' at times but then I just lost myself in it and he fucking killed it. It's really impressive. Also, Monica Barbaro too is such a force in this, she makes herself seem larger than life in such subtle ways. There's like a fire to her performance and I thought she was another standout, besides Edward Norton who always just rocks. 

Yeah like, it can get a little ""Walk Hard' when Timotthee's up there playing fucking blues with a black guy, or he's playing Blowin' in the Wind and we've got these up close shots of people looking at him like he's son of christ, but goddamnit he may just be! This was what it was like I bet! It's great watch and the songs are so good. Not sure if like I'm just ranking Bob Dylan here 4 and half stars or it's the movie but it could be combination of the both and that's okay. 

Dude's rock."
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,17,Very disappointed that they ACTIVELY chose to EXCLUDE the influence that Dewey Cox had on Bob Dylan and the 60s folk scene with songs iconic tracks like ‚ÄúLet Me Hold You Midget Man‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Mouse With the Overbite‚Äù.
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,18,"just saw this. the worst marketing move of all time was letting this get called a bob dylan biopic. if you walked in expecting to learn about bob dylan‚Äôs life, you‚Äôd be pissed when you walked out.

this movie was a phenomenal look at the soul of folk music and what it means to be a folk musician. having woody guthrie and pete seeger be the yin and yang of ‚Äúfolk music is the american anthem that we kill fascists to‚Äù and ‚Äúfolk music is the american glue that binds our shared history‚Äù that dylan struggles with was a great artistic call, and having his evolution shown through cash was the icing on the cake.

chalamet struggles a bit in the meekness of the first half, but absolutely sinks right in to the second half. mangold could‚Äôve had stronger directional choices, but did a good enough job guiding the film.

overall this movie isn‚Äôt one you watch as a biopic. it‚Äôs one you pair with inside llewyn davis for a weekend binge. solid showing."
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,19,Can Bob Dylan (Timothee) show up at my apartment at 4am asking for a towel for his black eye?
A Complete Unknown,1hlsi27,20,"I had my reservations about the movie going in, because I too loved *I'm Not There* and thought that Dylan is too complex of a person to fully explore in a run-of-the-mill biopic.

But I actually ended up being impressed with the movie.

It does a good job understanding and capturing the core essence of Dylan: the subconscious, visceral instinct to always seek change, in many cases in defiance of external influences. It felt like the film is laser focused on portraying this essence, the craving for change for the sake of change, during the first and perhaps the most consequential period of change in Dylan's life.

Ironically, I felt like this choice to limit the scope of the film to such an extreme degree created a better, more authentic portrayal of Dylan. If the movie tried to expand its theme to other aspects of Dylan, like his activism, his interpersonal relationships, his past, etc., it would have felt like a cheap imitation. Instead, this movie makes it clear that this Dylan is a caricature, which in turn lends more credence.

The performances were superb, of course. Everyone was great, but Timothee Chalamet really nailed his portrayal of Dylan. The mannerisms, the voice, everything. I definitely saw him as Dylan as the movie went on."

Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,1,Cant believe there was no Lust emotion as she entered puberty and teenage years. Where was the arc of her interest in boys developing etc?? Kinda felt half assed tbh.
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,2,really late to the discussion but when joy's imagination was depicting anxiety it 100% seemed a reference to the south park Canadian characters animation-wise
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,3,"Cringe, so cringe

6.5/10"
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,4,"I feel like the counterparts were more like companion emotions like sadness/ embarrassment, fear/ anxiety, and the diametric joy/ ennui and disgust/ envy. 

I agree, anger has no counterpart. I feel like most tools we use to counteract large emotions like anger, fear and sadness are more rational than emotional, like grace and empathy. Emotions are storms, they don‚Äôt have perfect antidotes. You need to understand yourself and others to get to the bottom of why we feel the way we do."
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,5,Loved the movie! Especially liked the events after the anxiety attack scene and shed a tear.
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,6,"Loved the movie. Especially the anthropomorphic depiction of human emotions and the complex nature it can take. This hit me more than the first movie having gone through panic attacks and feeling the utter loss of control.


Finding yourself in your teenage years is probably a core question for many teens, even though mine was pretty smooth, i can still relate. I think the older you are the more this movie hits. Joys realization that Anxiety sometimes just takes over is so real, that when you grow up your emotions become more complex and hence you feel less joy (A reason why people think in the past everything was better. It was not. By almost any metric. You just grew up). Also loved the diverse cast. It's almost 2025, we live in a diverse world and have diverse friends and I celebrate that fact.


Riley becoming hyper sensitive with her emotions is too true. You have to let them feel their emotions and resolve it, they will come back as a more balanced person, understanding themselves better. Many parents do it still wrong.



Loved Rileys apology at the end and admitting that everything is in fact NOT OK. Signifies growth. Watched it 2 times in the cinema, once with friends and once with family, nieces, cousins and all.


The depiction of our secrets locked in a vault hidden from everyone is beautiful. We all have our guilty pleasures we won't share xD



This movie is a gem as was the first one. Usually I wouldn't wish for another one when a movie concludes in such high notes but I wish for more. There is something to learn in these movies which is incredibly valuable."
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,7,"I really enjoyed inside out 2, the first one just hit the spot a smidge more. Side note, while I don‚Äôt think they need a third movie, I can see them introducing a younger sibling and Riley coping with it as a young adult. I can see all emotions going into overdrive again and there‚Äôs got to be a lesson in there Pixar can conjure up!"
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,8,inside out 3 w be in adulthood phase (R ratedüòè)
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,9,Meh 6.5/10 I like the ps2 guy
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,10,"Finally got around to watching this, and thought it was pretty ‚Äúmeh‚Äù honestly. It‚Äôs basically just the first film again, but not as emotionally impactful. I also feel like they didn‚Äôt balance the drama and humour as well this time around. Most of the film is just Riley feeling like total shit, and it makes for kind of a miserable viewing experience honestly. 

In general, I feel like this would have made a solid 30 minute special, but there wasn‚Äôt enough here to justify stretching out to a full film."
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,11,"I really like that throughout 1 and 2, the emotions were in control of Riley, but after the panic attack, Riley was the one who commanded Joy. The Belief System scene at the beginning is, in my opinion, the most beautiful scene Pixar created. It‚Äôs just so ethereal and pure."
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,12,The amount of forced diversity is way too noticeable in the movie.
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,13,"I just finished this now and I really didn‚Äôt expect to cry. As someone who‚Äôs living with overthinking, anxiety and fear, that just hit me. Such a great movie!"
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,14,I just watched it and loved this movie so much
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,15,Ennui was the best character. No contest
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,16,"It was great but also felt like a mini episode rather than a film. It only took place over 3 days? And the parents had basically no part in it. Riley had the weekend from hell lol started puberty, experienced 3947 forms of peer pressure, had her first panic attack, staged her first break in‚Ä¶good lord"
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,17,"Holy crap that's a movie I genuinely enjoyed watching since the Barbie movie. The animation is really solid, they did a great job making us love and hate the emotions. I despised anxiety but we know that Riley needs her just like how she also need all her bad memories instead of tucking them away. It's always about finding the good balance and not losing your sense of self. Very thoughtful movie, made me tear up, easily my favorite Disney-Pixar movie along with Soul."
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,18,"The way I googled, ‚Äòis there an Inside Out 3‚Äô as soon as I finished the film. I LOVED it.

Also, I need Disgust and Ennui plushies asap."
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,19,"The gag with the cool video game dude rolling past the workers, but somehow causing them to all perfectly chain reaction lock themselves in the vault was one of the funniest things I've seen"
Inside Out 2,1dfdj6n,20,"Can someone plz for the love of god explain to me why anger and fear are men from all of the emotions ? Do you guys think Hollywood is tryna say that fear and anger are the only feeling which men sympathize with ?¬†
Is this a subliminal message they tryna impose ? What do you guys think ?"

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,1cz9wud,18,"Dementus had a top 5 most horrific death ive ever seen holy fuck, extremely well deserved too

This movie kicked ass, took a bit to get going but it did not slow down once it did. I really liked the ‚Äòfable‚Äô style they went with for it"
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,1cz9wud,19,"First word out of Cannes on this movie was not to expect another Fury Road and I can definitely see now why they'd want to highlight that. This isn't Fury Road, which purposely revs its engines at the beginning and then only builds momentum from there. The moments to stop and breathe in that movie happen after long, brutal action sequences where everything is travelling 80mph. This movie is the opposite, seemingly on purpose. There are long sequences of lore and story punctuated by big action setpieces, the setup takes its time going an hour without aging up to Anya, and it's all about context which Fury Road purposely leaves to the imagination. But the real question is, does this movie rock and fuck and bang in its own way? The answer is a resounding yes from me.

First and foremost, even though it's used more sparingly, the action in this still goes incredibly hard. The first war rig scene where she's hiding under the rig with a bike strapped to the under carriage was some classic Mad Max shit. I squealed with joy every time someone got crumpled under a tire or a vehicle exploded. There is also some wildly impressive dirt bike stuntwork at play. The construction set piece with the giant gate locking Jack into bullet town was a classic multifaceted action scene, not to mention the first time we meet Joe and he gets that guy to suicide bomb Dementus was a fantastic scene with great tension and release.

I've gone through and filled all my George Miller gaps in the last few months and maybe the most notable thing about him, other than his clear insanity, is that he does sequels and franchise continuations like no one else. Usually not what you'd expect story-wise and if it is he's doing it so much bigger and more ridiculous. Fury Road is like if he made Matrix: Revolutions first, it's all climactic action and plotlines converging. One of the great things about it is that it throws it all at you so efficiently that you can just sit back and watch the insanity. Furiosa is like going back and doing Matrix and Reloaded, it's adding depth to Fury Road and it makes the journey and the character more interesting.

Furiosa always seemed to me like someone who spent years gaining Joe's trust and planning her escape, and that is the broad stroke of this movie, but it's so much more interesting and intricate than that. This is an epic that spans fifteen years and even though you know where it ends up there's so much to tell. It gives more depth to the journey of her and Max trusting each other, knowing that the first person to ever give her a chance and treat her like a person was a Max type. You get to see why the Gastown/Citadel/Bullet Farm alliance is so strong because they all had a common enemy in Dementus. You get to see, from Furiosa's point of view, how men are killing the world.

Chris Hemsworth, by the way, having the time of his life. Both him and Anya giving very interesting performances. Anya not showing up until an hour into the movie and then an almost nonverbal performance, it's the kind of role that might scare away a less interesting actor because so much of it has to be internal. Dementus is a great foil for Furiosa, both lost their families to the wasteland and Dementus chooses to deteriorate the world for it and Furiosa has hope that she can still make something of it. He lost his children, she lost her mother, so it's like he lost his future and she lost her past. Hemsworth can't even keep Gastown functional because he can't see past tomorrow, he has nothing left and can only entertain himself day to day. 

Furiosa has nothing after she escapes the wife vault and she still forges a life for herself. I honestly loved that the climax of this movie, the prequel to the most furious action movie of the 2010s, is these two angrily sharing philosophy in the desert. I was hooked that whole conversation, it's so hard to hate stupid charming Hemsworth. But Furiosa strips him of everything; his power, his lieutenants, his cars, and turns him into the living embodiment of a person being crushed by hope and the planet he tried to kill in his grief. Women, as the bringers of life, are inherently hopeful and men inherently aimless and destructive. This movie zeroes in on that best of all the Mad Max films. 

I have to shoutout how they represented the ""cars are religion"" lore. I loved how when she first meets Dementus he's being explained the torque and horsepower of his carriagecycle by the historian. It feels like an almost religious ritual to sit down and learn about engines every day, not to mention the whole War Rig building workshop they have. You can feel Miller has so much to show us in this insane post apocalypse genre he basically invented, even after 40 years and 5 movies.

Complaints? Sure I've got some. This is such a bigger and more unwieldy movie than Fury Road. The pacing is kinda crazy, we spend an hour with young Furiosa but when the ""wasteland war"" starts it's mostly done in montage. It fits in the sense that this is a Furiosa movie, but I can't be the only one who wanted some sweet epic war scenes. My biggest gripe, though, is probably under utilization of the score. The Junkie XXL score in Fury Road boosts that movie into ""Hell fuckin' yeah!"" territory and I felt this movie really holding the score back and there was a clear lack of guitar riffs. It felt on purpose but it seemed like the great action scenes could have been further elevated by a harder hitting score. Overall it's an 8/10 for me. It's not perfect but I'm so into what Miller is doing and the world that is clearly such a representation of his insane worldview that I was hooked the entire time.

Conclave,1jr0qw5,1,"I hadn‚Äôt thought about this movie in years and yet it has lived rent-free in my mind since I was 13. This may have been the movie to teach me about tropes, really, the way that it so effectively uses all the familiar conspiracy thriller beats a la ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù got branded into my young mind. I was actually quite surprised to see when I looked it up on Letterboxd that people don‚Äôt like this movie. I rewatched it this week and, while obviously not perfect, I still got quite a nostalgic kick out of it. 

Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker, a truly early 2000s cast, not to mention Leslie Bibb who is currently having her White Lotus moment. It‚Äôs actually insane to think this was 25 years ago, she still looks fantastic. I also love that this movie is mostly about Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen beefing. You‚Äôve got Coach and the Manhunter himself pulling these strings and they just give me such great ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù vibes. 

As far as similar conspiracy thrillers go, maybe this isn‚Äôt the most unique one. But it is so specific to a time and place. I really loved the moment when the plethora of models walk into the Skulls party and Higher by Creed starts playing, and they basically play the song in full with lyrics. It‚Äôs no mystery why 13-year-old me latched onto this. Plus you‚Äôve got some Papa Roach, some Collective Soul, some Fatboy Slim. This just really takes me back to a simpler time. 

There‚Äôs definitely a fantasy element that probably played really well to me back then too. The fantasy of one day being accepted into the elites, all your money problems and unsure future plans suddenly secured. I loved the touch that when he‚Äôs taking money out of the ATM it says, ‚Äú$20,019.43‚Äù or something, implying that he wouldn‚Äôt even have been able to take out twenty dollars in the first place. Not just the fantasy of security, but also the idea that a 19-year-old could pull one over on a 200 year old secret society that has endless resources and surveillance.

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training,1jw7pm2,1,Movies and movie stardom are a product of capitalism hahah
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training,1jw7pm2,2,Capitalism is the only reason we have movie stars to begin with. Stupid take
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training,1jw7pm2,3,So much negativity on Reddit. I wonder why!
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training,1jw7pm2,4,"Technology killed movie stars, not capitalism. The concept of a star is something that is deeply ingrained in human nature. We seem to have a fundamental need to venerate people in some form or another and imagine we have a parasocial relationship with them. But what technology did was to give us other outlets for people's attention. So stardom became watered down across all these mediums. But there are still huge stars who command the exact same sort of ""I'll watch it because it's them"" phenomenon. 50M+ people watch everything that Mr Beast puts out. That's easily the kinds of numbers of people that movie stars used to achieve, albeit at a much lower $/view than movie goers. But then again he puts out tens of videos each year whereas most movies stars will only put out 1 (maybe 2) films a year, so he's probably coming close to their $ draw as well.

Movie stars used to have wide appeal because the ways to build narrow appeal were primitive to non-existent. But with social media, streaming and so many other ways to connect with those producing content that's much more specific to your interests, there's no more reason to waste your attention on aloof movie stars who only interact with you through tabloid media. Instead, you can connect directly with people who actually read your comments and often respond. That's a much more powerful sort of parasocial relationship than the one offered by Hollywood. And that's why the younger generation is opting much more for these new sorts of media stars and the only movie stars left are ones who built their reputation before the age of social media. Internet-native generations aren't really caring about movie stars."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,1,"A great example of restraint in filmmaking. They could have gone big about mental health, about Jewishness, about the Holocaust and instead we have Eisenberg‚Äôs quiet speech that effectively but quietly expresses the contradictions and complexity of his relationship with his cousin. You could even argue that the two main characters don‚Äôt have arcs but nonetheless they feel real.

On another topic: I totally didn‚Äôt realize Jennifer Grey was in this and I read about it two days earlier. Hopefully she‚Äôll have a bigger career with her different face."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,2,"The death camp sequence was handled so, so well, so reverent and just deeply disquieting and disturbing-very well done."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,3,"The first morning in Poland, when the characters are waking up in the hotel room, Jesse Eisenberg's character walks out of the bathroom to see Kieren's character passed out on the bed, face down. Eisenberg takes a beat, which at this point in the movie we are left to assume is because of Kieren sleeping late, or some other comedic reason. Later in the film, we learn that Kieren's character had previously attempted suicide, and that the image of Kieren passed out is what Eisenberg's character has held on to mentally (and even addresses specifically in their rooftop discussion later in the film) - meaning that we watched Eisenberg's character casually stumble into his worst fear, finding Kieren asleep and not knowing if he is alive. Setting this scene up so early in the film really paid off, and gives the film a lot of nuance - and makes me want to watch another time in order to pick up any other clues. Kudos to Eisenberg for writing, directing, and acting in this film because he had a clear vision of what he wanted to accomplish."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,4,"Benji going up to ask Marcia if she was walking alone because she was a loser had my whole theatre laughing. Lots of great jokes in this one, well-balanced with the serious and emotional nature of the trip and the brothers' relationship."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,5,"The way Jessie Eisenberg‚Äôs character was wearing his shirts was infuriating. Other than that, I really enjoyed it."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,6,"As an introvert, I felt when the guide gave heartfelt farewells to everyone and then gave a simple ‚Äúgoodbye, David‚Äù and wave."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,7,"Loved this, simplicity at its finest. I know Kieran will get a majority of this films attention but Jesse surprised me the dinner scene was acted and written so beautifully. Overall 9/10 and I think this could easily take Original screenplay"
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,8,"As a Pole, I must admit that watching this film was a unique experience. Rarely is my country portrayed in this way in Hollywood movies, if at all. That is to say, Poland here still serves merely as the setting for a ""Holocaust film,"" a backdrop through which characters and tour participants pass, interacting only with objects and places that hold some significance for them‚Äîsentimental or practical. However, this is undoubtedly a deliberate artistic choice, meant to emphasize the participants' alienation from their surroundings, rather than a result of ignorance or oversight.

Poland is portrayed in an exceptionally positive light here, as a vibrant and developing country, not just an eternal cemetery. Watching this film was especially meaningful for me because I live in Warsaw, literally down the street from where the characters walked. I know and pass by almost all the locations featured in the movie on a daily basis. Moreover, just two weeks ago, I was on a business trip to Lublin, visited the Majdanek Museum, and even stayed in the same hotel where the characters smoked their last joint.

I've never before had the experience of following almost the exact same route as characters in a movie. (I‚Äôll add that the interior of the mentioned hotel is not as dingy as shown in the film‚Äîit‚Äôs modern and elegant, albeit a bit kitschy. üòä) A fantastic movie, highly recommended. I‚Äôm hoping Culkin earns a nomination."

A Real Pain,1grn0jw,10,"Benji is an all-time trigger for us social anxiety sufferers. I was dying in my seat.

Great script and the last joint scene on the roof was terrific."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,11,I like the last shot because Benji seemed so open and extroverted when he was with David but alone was really reserved but seemed to want others to reach out .  With that little lean he did to the person sitting next to him but said nothing. As if David gave him the confidence to just be free openly.
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,12,"Yeah it's pretty easy to see why Kieran Culkin is getting Oscar buzz from this. He is very good, and you can tell he put a lot of effort into thinking about Benji's life, backstory, and all of his mannerisms.

Overall, an astounding film. One that makes me feel both immensely sad and hopeful at the same time. Benji really needed that trip, both for his grandmother and to see David - and even though it didn't magically fix everything, it feels like a start. And there's hope that David will be better in seeing Benji. I was really hoping he would invite him to dinner at the end in the airport, and I'm glad he did, even if Benji didn't accept, because it shows he can make the effort and maybe he'll continue to try."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,13,"The prospect of Roman Roy and Mark Zuckerberg ln a Holocaust trip as hilarious.¬†


Really felt like this year's Holdovers. The underlying story is really quite sad but there's still a lot of warmth and good humor sprinkled throughout it.


And Kieran Culkin is a bona fide star."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,14,"Great writing and pace by Jesse Eisenberg. It was perfectly casted and felt like the role was written for Kieran Culkin to play. As a kid I was the introvert with wild extrovert friends/cousins and could relate to their relationship a lot (being embarrassed by them but also wishing I was more like them).


The one thing that bothered me was when David says I wish I knew what it was like to light up a room with charm like you do.. I wanted Benji to ask him what happens when you go home to your wife and kid? I bet you make them smile when you enter the room. Because at the end of the film we see the huge hug and excitement from his kid when he gets home."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,15,"As someone who did a similar trip, this movie was super accurate and well done. I loved the dynamic between the two cousins and how much pain each of them was carrying. I think the scene where Jesse Eisenberg is telling their family's story at the restaurant and then Kieran comes in playing the piano was quite brilliant. It's not a movie I can see myself watching over and over, but I'm really glad I saw it."
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,16,One detail I really enjoyed about the movie is David going on about how Benji can light up a room and he‚Äôll do anything to know how that feels like and in the end you see his child and his wife run up to him because they‚Äôre excited to see him. David has more than he realizes
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,17,The title of the movie has so many different meanings. It‚Äôs perfect. Kieran is amazing but I think that performance is enhanced so much by Jesse‚Äôs reactions. Jesse is definitely going to be overshadowed but is just as good. They felt like real cousins. Hilarious and extremely respectful.
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,18,"This one hit pretty hard. Kieran's performance is just so intimate, on the surface it can feel like he's rehashing the wild card Roman Roy thing, but the more we dig into him the more we see him as so much more vulnerable and in pain. 

Of course, this movie is called A Real Pain and it is all about pain. Generational pain, present suffering in the world, how we engage with or ignore it, how we stuff it down or let it bubble to the surface, how we react when we see it in others. It's actually quite impressive how many different ways this movie finds to talk about pain, just the general pain we all feel as people, in such a short and tight movie about going on a holocaust tour. 

Both leads are so well written and acted. David says it so well about Benji, ""You light up a room and then you shit all over everything in it."" He can't help but say what he's thinking at all times but his charm and eccentric nature make him palatable in small doses. He calls people out for being boring or for not engaging with their pain, but those are also the things that cause him such depression. It was very touching watching the tour guide admit to him that no one ever gets real about criticizing the tour and thanking him for it despite Benji hurting his feelings in the moment and barely even remembering doing it. And then the tour guide turns to Dave and says, ""Bye Dave!""

And that's the kind of silent part of this movie is how Dave is feeling. We are always watching Benji because he's so charismatic and funny, but Dave is someone who represses his pain, rarely says what's on his mind. This movie doesn't really side with one way or another, really it just gives us two very different viewpoints on how to deal with the overwhelming nature of being human, faults and all. Amazing scene when David rants about Benji at dinner, how broken he is and how frustrating it is to spend time with him. He wins momentary favor and sympathy from the group, only for Benji to start playing piano and instantly everyone is back sympathizing for Benji and lamenting at how one so charming and talented could be so sad. Great directorial touch for David to leave back to the hotel and still hear the piano playing in his head followed by applause for Benji. You can imagine his whole life has been his head being invaded by how everyone treats and reacts to Benji in a similar way. 

Overall, really great movie, 8/10 for me. I love movies that are simple, this never delves into situational comedy or has some sort of plot event that derails the movie. I kept waiting for them to get locked on a rooftop or get lost or get hurt but none of that happens, it's just about how they engage with all the feelings of being a person with a rich and painful history but an aimless future. I thought it was beautiful and heartbreaking, neither cousin solves anything by the end. They just gotta keep moving forward.

/r/reviewsbyboner"
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,19,"David‚Äôs speech at the dinner table is what will give this film an Oscar. I didn‚Äôt like Benji at first because his mannerisms seemed forced, but then I realized that they were forced because he was masking his profound depression. I know‚Ä¶duh.. but seriously I could go on about this movie for hours with someone. Loved it"
A Real Pain,1grn0jw,20,"Beautiful movie. Heartbreaking movie.

Rare film where I felt the emotional impact by the very end when the credits rolled. Seeing Kieran‚Äôs manic expressions after Jesse left him were tough to watch. You know he told his cousin that he‚Äôs ok‚Ä¶ but the pain is there. Not to mention Jesse‚Äôs reveal about the OD. Just genuinely made me saddened for what they were going through. 

Great job from everyone. I hope there are some Oscar nominations coming everyone‚Äôs way"

Civil War,1jrtvzp,1,"Alex Garland, director of **Ex Machina**, **Civil War**, **Warfare**, **Annihilation**, and **Men** will be joining us on /r/movies next Tuesday 4/8 at 4:00 PM ET for an AMA/Q&amp;A. It'll go live around 9 AM ET and be pinned to the top of the subreddit. He's also written **Sunshine**, **Dredd**, **28 Days/Weeks/Years Later**, and **Never Let Me Go**.

**Warfare** is out in theaters nationwide next week.

&gt; A surveillance mission goes wrong for a platoon of American Navy SEALs in insurgent territory in Iraq.

Civil War,1jrtvzp,2,~~Pretty sure~~ Garland didn't write 28 Weeks.
Civil War,1jrtvzp,3,I don't think he's prepared for the number of Dredd questions he's going to get
Civil War,1jrtvzp,4,"Oh fuck yes, this is awesome"
Civil War,1jrtvzp,5,And Devs!
Civil War,1jrtvzp,6,"Hello Alex! Glad you did this AMA in this community, have to say, I‚Äôm one of your biggest fans, from CIVIL WAR to MEN to ANNIHILATION to EX MACHINA‚Ä¶ honestly congratulations. Some questions for you: Which movie was the hardest to write? And also what can we expect from WARFARE compared to your previous movies in terms of cinematography, genre, etc‚Ä¶ again, thank you for doing this AMA and answering me!"
Civil War,1jrtvzp,7,"hello Alex, Ex Machina is one of my favorite films of the last decade and my question is

In Ex Machina, the boundaries between artificial intelligence and human emotion are blurred‚Äîwhat message were you hoping to convey about consciousness and the ethical responsibilities of AI creators?"
Civil War,1jrtvzp,8,Fuck. Yes.
Civil War,1jrtvzp,9,Not to mention The Beach with collab director Boyle!

Civil War,1jrtvzp,13,"He may even announce ""Civil Warfare II"""
Civil War,1jrtvzp,14,What made you decide to do 3 28 years later films? Was the story so big you wanted it to have enough Time to be told properly
Civil War,1jrtvzp,15,What‚Äôs the hardest thing scheduling wise about the job¬†
Civil War,1jrtvzp,16,"Dredd was an absolutely amazing adaptation and a sleeper cult classic.

The world of 2000ad has many other sci fi and dystopian themes that jive well with your catalogue of films.

Would you like to see any other 2000ad adaptations?

If so which ones would you like to see?

For me personally, as much as I'd love to see Urban wear the Judges uniform again, it would be cool to see Strontium Dogs or the likes of ABC warriors adapted for the big screen."
Civil War,1jrtvzp,17,Is it true that you stepped in to direct a lot of Dredd?
Civil War,1jrtvzp,18,Can you please make Ex Machina 2 (Deux lol)?

It really comes off that you find something interesting to latch onto in everything you see with only a few exceptions for the ones at the bottom of the list. And even then, it feels like everything is given a chance.

I really enjoyed this list. I hope 2023 brings you many more exciting trips to the cinema."
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,2,Wait a second... which pinocchio? At a 6/10 I'm unsure if u dislike  the del Toro one or liked the Disney one haha.
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,3,"I‚Äôm surprised you thought **Mrs Harris Goes To Paris** only deserves 5/10.

Did you not watch **Everything Everywhere All At Once,** or did I miss it?

Edit: found it - 8/10"
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,4,"Really interesting thoughts, but the rating the stood out to me the most was Blonde - 8/10"
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,5,"This guy is singlehandedly keeping cinema alive. Kudos to you. I can't afford to see more than a handful of films a year so I have to be very picky, but I would love to see every one released if I could afford it."
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,6,Wow. Can I ask why you only gave Flee a 4/10?
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,7,"I thought Bullet Train was a really fun movie. Not amazing or anything, but I had a lot of fun watching it."
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,8,"I just wanted to let you know that I look forward to this post every year. It will be a 104 movie year for me, catching I Wanna Dance With Somebody today."
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,9,2/10 for Hatching? That one really threw me.
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,10,"Do you use Letterboxd? If not, it would be perfect for this kind of thing."
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,11,"Man, I saw 150 movies this year and thought that was a lot, LOL.

More power to you, and thanks for the reviews."
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,12,Doctor Strange 2 and Everything Everywhere receiving the same score is a travesty
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,13,"&gt;Morbius 4/10

I think you mean 14/10, movie of the decade."
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,14,"When I saw Worst Person in the World in theaters, so many uncomfortable guys with sobbing dates when the credits rolled. I got teary eyed myself though"
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,15,"Someone who's seen Ramona! I still have to catch it but your high praise will finally push me to watch it. I wasn't enamoured by the trailer. 

I agree that Official Competition is Penelope Cruz's best performance to date. 

I read the book that Simple Passion is based on. It's only about 80 pages long so I wondered how they would make a film out of it. A shame that's it nowhere near as good as the book. Happening is also based on an auto fiction by the same author, Annie Ernaux."
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,16,"I think I saw like three movies in theaters this year, and the only one I remember was Morbius. I saw it with some buddies and it was probably the best movie experience I've had in a long, long time. The movie wasn't good in any way but we had so much fun because we knew it was bad

I haven't watched it again, but one of the guys I saw it with did and he said it was super boring and had nothing redeemable about it

So I guess that's my movie experience for this year"
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,17,Sonic 2 is 10/10 and you're not gonna change my mind. üò§
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,18,"Well that's impressive! [I also released my list of favorite of the year](https://www.takeaside.ca/post/matt-s-20-favorite-films-of-2022), but it's always fun to see someone's take and you clearly saw A LOT! How cool was it after the pandemic to be able to go to the movies all the time? Love it."
A Little Something Extra,zzvg5y,19,"I'm a cinephile, but I'll tip my hat to a true master.  Overall, I felt your rankings were spot on, and your love for film shines through your brief synopsis reviews.   I'm not surprised that you ranked Babylon near the top of your list, when I watched it I had mixed feelings about the film, but several days later I can't stop thinking about it.   For people who watch a lot of films, Babylon was the apex of grand Hollywood film making, a tribute to cinema and the art form, but casual film goers will most likely get put off by the films vulgarity.

I'm going to check out some of the films on this list.  Overall I felt this was a crummy year for film, but now I might see some movies that will change my mind."

Arthur the King,1bf2qge,1,This is the type of movie they would make us watch after reading the book in middle school
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,2,"I had seen the trailer 5 times at the cinema, and 5 times decided I did not want to see it. So of course it was last Mondays Mystery Movie. And I have to say the entire plot of the movie was shown in the trailer, so not a whole lot of a movie to discover. I‚Äôm not a dog person, so seeing cute shots of a lovable stray is not going to save a movie for me."
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,3,"I feel like they didn't really show any connection made between Wahlbergs character and the dog...besides just feeding it a few meatballs. 
That's where the movie fell really flat. They could have shown how the dog kept up with the team, they could have shown the dog giving the team motivation, they could have shown the bond between the team and the dog. 
When Wahlberg stops the kayak and goes back for Arthur, it didn't feel earned at all. 
They could have also shown the crazy things the team had to do in the race. Like the zipline moment kept me on the edge of my seat, but they didn't really show much more crazy stuff.
A disappointing movie that could have been much more. - a generous 6/10...only because Arthur is a good boy"
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,4,"Wow I‚Äôm surprised people thought it was that bad. I enjoyed it a lot. Sure, it‚Äôs not the best movie I‚Äôve ever seen, but I can think of a shit ton of movies I‚Äôve seen in the past few years that were way worse."
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,5,"Those talking trash unfortunately didn‚Äôt see the same movie I did? It is an extraordinary story that is faithful to the actual events and Mark Wahlberg was a good fit to play the role of a selfish guy humbled under extreme and unique circumstances. There‚Äôs been hundreds of these extreme races and no team before since has ever thrown the race to rescue a dog. For anyone who‚Äôs ever experienced anything even close, this movie should resonate with you."
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,6,"The scene where Wahlberg has to leave the dog behind and he's explaining it to the dog and he says ""Arthur, don't be like that!"" honestly not far off from that SNL bit where Samberg impersonates Wahlberg talking to animals. 

One of the more emotionally manipulative movies I've seen in a while. I'm definitely a dog person so it worked on me at moments, but by the fourth time we have to watch this dog almost die I was getting really tired of it. The underwater shot of the dog drowning was too much, way too much. Then the movie spends too long on what happened after the race and still ends up very predictable. 

The story is honestly kind of interesting and judging solely by the pictures shown at the end, seemingly accurate. It's wild that people actually do this and it's a huge sponsored event. But the most interesting aspect is something this movie totally ignored. How DID the dog make that trek to find them again? I thought they were gonna be like ""He must have done this!"" and used his tactics to win or decided they should just be following him. But no, they're just like ""I dunno that's pretty wild"" and that's it. They ziplined and mountain biked and climbed to get there and the dog just walks right in.

In the kayaking scene when Simu Liu said, ""He's one of us, we're going back"" the older woman in front of me literally clapped. And most people in my theater were crying the second or third time they said the dog was definitely going to die. So I would call this a crowdpleaser, but for me it just felt like they were purposely reminding me of my past good bois to make me like Mark Wahlberg more and that's a big ask. 4/10

Does add a great line read to the Mark Wahlberg Canon. ""That's the dog I gave meatballs to!""

/r/reviewsbyboner"
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,7,CGI EYELIDS
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,8,"It made for a more exciting scene, but why didn't Nathalie's character clip her carabiner to the zip line? I can see being tethered to the bike as a safety, but just letting go and only being connected by that? Didn't make sense as Wahlberg had already done it.


Also the characters' name is Olivia. I don't know if ""Climber"" in the cast listing is a joke to how meh this movie is."
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,9,Did we really need a dog drowning shot?
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,10,Poor mediocre white man has nothing to his name except a beautiful home and loving family :(
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,11,There‚Äôs no rule that says a dog can‚Äôt adventure race!
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,12,"I enjoyed this movie so much.¬† If you are a dog person who likes dog movies like Benji and Lassie, etc. then you will like it. It made me cry and I thought it was a great testament to the power of the will to survive. Definitely going to read the book.¬† I also had no idea ""adventure racing"" existed so that was interesting.¬† Bottom line is if the trailer and concept appeals to you,¬† you'll like the movie. p.s.¬† If you think this one looks like schlock but want to watch a genuinely excellent dog movie,¬† then check out Togo with Willem Dafoe.¬†"
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,13,"Wow! Just saw the movie and loved it .
Love Mark Wahlberg and love dogs.
What a sad world we live in when we can't marvel and enjoy a true story of inspiration and love"
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,14,"Why was there an f bomb in this movie, it felt random and out of place."
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,15,"I'm kind of a sucker for tearjerky dog movies so I went in with slightly-raised expectations but was immediately let down. You could tell from the first 3-minute GoPro-filmed, poorly-acted/written, corny opening sequence that you were in for a rough time.

Pretty awful overall."
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,16,I guess this would be passable for an in-flight movie
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,17,"There was a part in the movie where some local took them in a boat during the race,it looks like that would be a disqualification?"
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,18,"On the one hand I feel like the RT score is too high. On the other, I am sort of glad that movies that aren't genre are still being released. That said it isn't exactly what you'd call fresh or original, but yeah there are moments of competent direction and dialogue. 

Many people will forget this movie in a month but maybe it will stick in someone's head for longer. Or they'll confuse it with the Art of Racing in the Rain."
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,19,"Cute dog but that's it.

It just the typical dog and man friendship movie with very little creative ideas, boring characters and dull style. Based on Mikael Lindnord, the movie really doesn‚Äôt offer much besides being the most standard and basic dog movie with little charm between the characters and boring dynamics. Throughout, the production and camerawork is solid as there were some solid camerawork choices and production designs. But that‚Äôs really about it.

The performances were just...meh but none of the characters were really funny, engaging nor interesting to connect. At least the dog wasn‚Äôt CGI. The dialouge is pretty rough, the structure is pretty boring, and realistically, it almost made me fall asleep.

Dog lovers will like this movie but everything else, that‚Äôs all.

3/10"
Arthur the King,1bf2qge,20,"Just saw this movie. I enjoyed it for what it was. I knew the original story and people from it, so I thought it was utterly hysterical they race swapped his entire team of Swedes to meet a quota. Cue the eye roll. And of course changing things around to be more 'Hollywood' pleasing, but since I knew the story, I thought it was fine."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,1,"This only worked for me because of Garfield and Pugh who carried a very uninteresting script. The story was IMO very standard. I also thought that the out-of-order storytelling hindered it more than helped it. 

It was fine, I think that if anyone else had been cast it would've scored lower for me. Florence especially really squeezed as much as she could out of what she was given. She's one of the best of her generation for sure."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,2,You do not need three fucking bowls to crack eggs.
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,3,"When he apologized but first pointed out she was rude, I felt that."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,4,I feel like with any other actors this could‚Äôve been a solid 6.5 classic melodrama with the slight gimmick but because their performances are so amazing I would give this an 8 and I was moved and entertained. Yes the characters make stupid decisions and it‚Äôs a bit quirky in that 2014 Fault in Our Stars/ 500 Days of Summer way but it was refreshing to see a movie so ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and sweet.
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,5,"I'm shocked at how in and out of this film I was. I love Garfield and Pugh, and the non-linear storytelling kept it kind of fresh, but I still found myself largely uninterested.

The bathroom birth scene was a delight however. So funny and touching."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,6,Shockingly boring script. The film was so understated the gas station scene was jarring.
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,7,"I was really excited for this because my favorite movie is About Time, and I thought this would have a similar rom-com but also cry my heart out vibe. Sadly I didn't shed a single tear because I hated Almut/Pugh's character. The inconsistency with her character and also the medical inaccuracies of the move ruined it for me.

First, she was a bitch when Tobias wanted to have a completely valid conversation about children, which made me dislike her. Tobias compromises on kids for her, so she gets her way. Then, she changes her mind and decides she wants kids. Okay, that's realistic. Wait, now she wants biological kids so bad that she's hugely increasing her risk of dying from cancer? Ummm, okay I guess. Oh, this woman who wanted a child SO BAD decides to neglect her and be insanely selfish? Having her give up on recovery to do a...competition...when she's already a hugely accomplished chef and figure skater...and lie to her family the whole time and spend what little time she has left working instead of with them? None of her actions match the character they tried to make. Someone who is so ambitious and career oriented wouldn't risk dying of cancer to have a child. Someone who wanted a child so badly wouldn't sacrifice their time with their young daughter for a competition, nor would they give up on treatment in the first place. And in the end, Tobias is a pushover again and gives up on the wedding for her competition. Now what I really don't understand is why she didn't just ask to change the date, I mean she could've come up with any excuse. 

Secondly, I am unfortunately a nurse, and the inaccuracies of all things medicine in the movie really took me out of it. ""I'll get you some antibiotics for the pain"" said by the doctor was the first red flag that the rest of the movie would be totally unrealistic because clearly the writers didn't even have someone to tell them that antibiotics won't help with pain. It really bugged me by how far they went by having Florence Pugh actually shave her head and a weird obsession with showing vomit just to miss the mark. Like, why did you shave this actress' head for chemo just to keep it a perfectly full buzzcut the whole time rather than actual chemo-induced hair loss? This is even ignoring the fact that if a real person was on chemo she wouldn't be able to do all of that stuff, and if she could in fact do all of that, then chemo wouldn't be so big of a deal that she would give up on treatment altogether. AND if she didn't do chemo at all, she would still be in pain and on medicine lowering her quality of life. They should not have made her prognosis appear so hopeful, because she literally immediately decided to give up. It would have been much better to scrap the storyline of this being a relapse altogether, not have the stakes of wanting a child be so high, or to have made it a more definitive death sentence."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,8,No one mentioning the dog symbolism at the ending scene. Getting a dog to get over the grief of losing Almut like they had discussed earlier in the movie
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,9,"Saw an early screening two weeks ago and plan to see it again this weekend. It doesn‚Äôt reinvent the romance genre, but it stars two of the best actors working today and it‚Äôs an emotional gut punch in the best way. I also like how intimate it felt like watching a real couple in their private moments instead of watching a movie couple sharing big romantic gestures"
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,10,"It‚Äôs basically all melodrama, but if you‚Äôre cool with that (I certainly was), it‚Äôs fantastic. Pugh and Garfield are incredibly empathetic actors by themselves; seeing them play off each other takes what could‚Äôve been a basic concept to the next level."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,11,"Loved this, but I was firmly in the target audience as a fan of both leads beforehand. They had incredible chemistry, and the movie was alternately funny and sad. Would highly recommend if you‚Äôre even considering going!"
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,12,"This movie had good performances but nonetheless it didn't have a strong storyline. The non linear structure didn't lead to unfolding anything interesting, you come to realise that if this story was linear it would expose the simplicity.

Also, I found the relationship dynamic selfish. Tobias made a lot of sweet gestures and expressed care and there were a lot of times where Almut mistreats him with no real motivation as to why? He expresses he wants kids (after she had earlier said she didn't) and she curses him out, he books a wedding, she lies to him and enters a competition and then makes him cancel with no apology. I couldn't see any true motivations for her to behave like that and with the cancer adding to the nature of limited time, it doesn't make sense for her to grow more selfish as her time becomes more limited.

I will say the emotional note of the movie was consistent and really held the film together.

I feel like the story committed to many angles and failed to lead strongly in any of them. It scored low for me, would be interested to hear more thoughts."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,13,"They handed out ""We Live in Time"" tissue packets to everyone before my screening last week. I did not cry, although I was moved by many parts of this movie, and I think this will be a tearjerker for many

Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh are very good, even if I wish they were given just a *little more* to work with. There's some very heartwarming, some very sad, and some very funny moments (my audience particularly enjoyed the search for a pen). The most interesting moment of all is the birth scene because I think it balances the variety of emotions very well - the confusion, the horror, the heartwarming, the comedy of the situation all come out masterfully."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,14,"i love both of these actors and was really excited for this movie. My expectations weren‚Äôt insanely high, but I thought at the least Id get a cute and interesting story with some good chemistry between the leads.



I was genuinely shocked walking out realizing how much I disliked most of this. The script was just straight up bad, and the decision to tell the story non-linearly was a poor decision. What a disappointment"
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,15,"Loved the motif of using time (physical and beyond) in every time skip that we see!
The stopwatch, the iPhone timer, the countdown clock when Almut was cooking, EVERYTHING!
Such a great movie, and the small details were so good."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,16,"[Literary analysis of We Live in Time](https://filmcolossus.com/we-live-in-time-explained-2024)

Review wise, I enjoyed the movie but the birth in the gas station scene was so ridiculous that it kind of took me out of the movie. Felt like a ridiculous sit com episode rather than something fitting the film. I‚Äôd have rather gotten more time with her and her daughter. Or her as a chef. Or something meaningful? That just felt a bit too storybook.

Pugh crushes it. Garfield doesn‚Äôt have much to do aside from be handsome and charming. Which is actually a nice reversal of how male-driven these movies usually are. 

Still cried but it didn‚Äôt break me like I thought it would. In terms of tears, on a 1 to Aftersun, it was like a 4 or 5 for me. 

If you‚Äôre looking for someone to make you fucking cry, watch this Korean movie called A Moment to Remember

I did like how We Live in Time looked at the ‚Äúdeath of a parent‚Äù idea from the parent‚Äôs perspective. But she‚Äôs also a child who lost a parent early and grew up. So there‚Äôs this sad hopefulness that the movie conveys. For kids who lose parents, you can go on. And for parents who will leave behind kids, the kids will be alright. That‚Äôs really touching."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,17,"I was surprised by how boring it was overall. 

I think Florence is an amazing actress and she carried; I‚Äôll be looking out for her. But honestly I was kind of waiting for it to be over. I felt the back and forth between time bits to be boring and her character to be kind of annoying. Her reasoning for competing and then lying to her family was a bit shallow. I also felt there to be no chemistry between the two. 

I didn‚Äôt cry and had been expecting to. I guess I was expecting a better script to translate into better scenes. It was pretty flat and underwhelming."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,18,"On the way home from the theatre, I genuinely asked my husband, ‚ÄúWas that a really strange &amp; weird form of propaganda for liberal/progressive women to have children?‚Äù 

I feel as though Al‚Äôs character was teed up to be this very progressive / liberal person - bisexual, ending a serious relationship due to not wanting children, emphasis on her career, not believing in marriage, etc. 

But then, Al‚Äôs actions completely misaligned with the character that she had been developed as. It felt like whiplash. Choosing to be with someone who really wanted children, choosing a riskier surgery in order to be able to have children, going through IVF (!!!) because she wanted to have a child that badly. 

But then they switched it up again, painting a picture as though she was prioritizing her career over time with family. It was as though they were like, ‚ÄúOh yeah, we forgot the character like, really cared about her career‚Äù - and that also felt like whiplash, because wait, I thought she was all about family/her child at this point? So then, it felt like we were supposed to feel frustrated with her for choosing her career over her family/recovery - but actually, that‚Äôs pretty on track with who this character was before they threw in the wrench of her apparently really really really badly wanting to be a mother. 

Al‚Äôs character just felt really contradictory &amp; unrealistic. I almost wish they would have just let the character be who she was from the jump rather than trying to squeeze in how non-traditional/progressive she was supposed to be. It felt like a cheap way of making her character more ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù or ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù, specifically to the A24 audience. 

I felt so distracted by this that I struggled to enjoy the movie as a whole. Solid acting though, Florence can do no wrong."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,19,"I love this movie and I can finally talk about in a discussion thread the things I loved and respected about this film ahhhh!! and I know I'll be in the minority of thinking it's a 5/5 star movie but idc. 

One thing that made me really love it was how little the score comes in during moments with the two leads. It makes it feel very raw, and this isn't uncommon sure. But I feel like when we get a scoreless emotional scene it's usually negative, but this one does it in most moments, especially the positive. I feel like this makes us feel less emotionally manipulated or emotionally guided by the music, and instead really let's us understand what the characters are feeling. We really sit with it. It feels very respectful to the audience.

I also think that another way that the movie treats it's audience with respect is the bouncing between different times in their lives without any sort of big transition or subtitling or anything, trusting that we will pick up on their different surroundings or pregnancy etc. yes, it isn't the hardest thing in the world to figure out the when, but I do feel like a lesser movie would've added like the year date or something when it would switch.

I also really respect and love that, despite the shitty circumstances the characters find themselves in, we get a lot of happy moments! I feel like I teared up and cried as much from the happy as I did the sad. 

While it was predictable that Florence would die after the conversation in the parking lot of the doctors when she mentions not, I think it worked well in that it wasn't immediate, and the story we get wasn't entirely just those great 6 months she talked about. She did go to treatments and didn't choose that route, when again I feel like a lesser movie would've. 

I mean the birthing scene is just incredible. You pretty much know what's going to happen at least when she waddles out of the car, but it's such a beautiful and raw moment that it doesn't matter how predictable it is. 

The hair shaving scene! Oh my god. What a fucking incredibly beautiful scene, definitely my favourite of the movie. The way they turn what is an incredibly sad, painful moment into such a lovely, vibrant, *joyful* memory for their daughter is breathtaking. I also remember thinking ""damn that looks really real, good job to hair and makeup"" and then found out after the movie it was her real hair lol. They did a lovely job filming what had to have been a one take or bust thing. Everything about the scene was perfect. 

This film succeeds in so many ways, and a lot of them are the smaller moments. This is a film of little moments, and thats really what life is isn't it? Yes we have big, joyful, celebratory or sad, life altering moments like the birthing scene or the competitions or the cancer diagnosis etc, but a majority of both the run time and real life is filled with smaller moments. I think that's part of why I really respect the off screen death, and the choice to show what happened in the final scene. It's just a father and his daughter cracking an egg. But we instantly get what happened, we know why, and we get this beautiful call back for us. But for them it's just a Tuesday making fresh eggs with dad. 

It's not reinventing the wheel but there are some interesting and good subversions of what a ""paint by numbers"" one of these films would be, and it just really worked for me. Beautiful film, I really adored it."
We Live in Time,1g67i4t,20,"Average as hell movie, only made watchable by the charismatic leads. Honestly watch this on a discount day or wait for it to go on streaming. You‚Äôre won‚Äôt be missing much."
Unsung Hero,1jr0qw5,1,"I hadn‚Äôt thought about this movie in years and yet it has lived rent-free in my mind since I was 13. This may have been the movie to teach me about tropes, really, the way that it so effectively uses all the familiar conspiracy thriller beats a la ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù got branded into my young mind. I was actually quite surprised to see when I looked it up on Letterboxd that people don‚Äôt like this movie. I rewatched it this week and, while obviously not perfect, I still got quite a nostalgic kick out of it. 

Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker, a truly early 2000s cast, not to mention Leslie Bibb who is currently having her White Lotus moment. It‚Äôs actually insane to think this was 25 years ago, she still looks fantastic. I also love that this movie is mostly about Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen beefing. You‚Äôve got Coach and the Manhunter himself pulling these strings and they just give me such great ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù vibes. 

As far as similar conspiracy thrillers go, maybe this isn‚Äôt the most unique one. But it is so specific to a time and place. I really loved the moment when the plethora of models walk into the Skulls party and Higher by Creed starts playing, and they basically play the song in full with lyrics. It‚Äôs no mystery why 13-year-old me latched onto this. Plus you‚Äôve got some Papa Roach, some Collective Soul, some Fatboy Slim. This just really takes me back to a simpler time. 

There‚Äôs definitely a fantasy element that probably played really well to me back then too. The fantasy of one day being accepted into the elites, all your money problems and unsure future plans suddenly secured. I loved the touch that when he‚Äôs taking money out of the ATM it says, ‚Äú$20,019.43‚Äù or something, implying that he wouldn‚Äôt even have been able to take out twenty dollars in the first place. Not just the fantasy of security, but also the idea that a 19-year-old could pull one over on a 200 year old secret society that has endless resources and surveillance. 

Overall, even knowing this is just a carbon copy of so many movies before it and since, this still hits for me. The soundtrack, the cast, the tropes, they just bring me right back. It‚Äôs a 7/10 for me. A movie above any other!"

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,1coec3x,1,"Opening the movie with the GOAT Maurice being the first ape we see was peak. 

Also i was expecting to see the Icarus spaceship finally landing back on earth when they went back to the telescope at the end. Seems like there‚Äôs still plenty of human intelligence and civilization leftover though (which is really surprising after 300 years and kinda threw me off on the ending a bit) so maybe it‚Äôs still too early for that"
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,1coec3x,2,"Raka was the best character in the movie, wish he had stuck around longer."
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,1coec3x,3,This is the second film in a row where an entire ape tribe is kidnapped lol
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,1coec3x,4,"Just an observation: the film is set in the ruins of Los Angeles. I only pinpointed that because you can see the LAX Theme Building in the background in one wide shot when Noa and Raka are leaving the airport. That being said, I once watched this post-apocalyptic series on the History Channel (Life After People) that hypothesized what would happen to the world if humans disappeared. In one episode, it was theorized that the semi wild zebras that today still live near Hearst Castle in central California would likely propagate and become an established species in North America. So when I saw those zebras in the film, I immediately thought of those Hearst zebras and wondered if they could be descendants. Great research by the filmmakers if that was indeed the case!"
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,1coec3x,5,"There were some gasps in my audience when it‚Äôs revealed Nova had her hand on her gun when speaking to Noa about if humans and apes could coexist at the end.

I loved that. Reminded me of when I saw Rise and Caesars ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù moment made someone in my audience say ‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù 

I really like that Noa and Nova aren‚Äôt on good terms at the end. Thought that was interesting.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,1coec3x,10,"At this point I think if they ended this 4+ film reboot series with a straight remake of the original it would be pretty disappointing. Why bother remaking a classic when these ORIGINAL stories are being super well received. 

These four are special and they should continue making original stories in this world."
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,1coec3x,11,"I always underestimate this franchise, and it always blows me away. I think it must be the titles. They're always so long it puts me off. No title should have two ""of thes"" in it. It's weird.

How the hell do they have me cheering for the apes instead of humanity? I was thinking, ""Don't trust her, Noa!"" all throughout that last meeting. And when they showed the gun she had behind her back...smh. 

Also, Eagle clan is sick af. Moment with Noa and his father's eagle with the sunset was so good."

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,1coec3x,18,"I do agree it doesn't rise to the heights of Dawn and War, but I still think it was a very good movie that was worthy to follow them. The visuals, both effects and cinematography, were spectacular and the performances were strong all around.

In that vein, huge shout out to Owen Teague as Noa. He gave a performance worthy to follow Andy Serkis as Caesar. And Kevin Durand was suitably menacing as Proximus.

I'm interested to see where things go from here. If they can maintain the quality, I'll always come back to this series."
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,1coec3x,19,"When Mae meets the human helping out Proximus, I was puzzled at how easily she could kill the only other speaking human on the planet. I had assumed it was to show her loyalty to the apes and manipulate them. I was also impressed that (I've had BJJ training) a text book blood chokehold on the human to to prevent him from leaving. I had thought maybe she learned it in a book?

Knowing her backstory at the ending makes a lot more sense. There were numerous people depending on her back in the shelter and Proximus could have become a major threat to them with the firearms there.  Killing his human was the smart call at zero loss to her. She probably received special training at the shelter akin to being a spy in modern times so they taught her combatives and shooting."

The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,2,"It's not a bad movie but it's not a great movie either. I don't understand why this won the Golden Lion or received a rapturous applause in Venice. Pedro Almod√≥var's dialogue doesn't translate well in English and for the first half, the acting from the two leading ladies sounded stagy and theatrical. It got better along the way and Tilda Swinton is superb as a dying woman who chooses Euthanasia but the whole movie feels half-assed and it should have been better. 
John Turturro shows up for a couple of scenes and does these speeches about the state of the world and I kept wondering what was the point. The movie seemed to indicate a potential reunion between Swinton and Turturro's characters, who were in a past affair, but that possibility was quickly cut out. 

Aesthetically, Almod√≥var didn't disappoint. The film is beautifully shot. The use of colors, snow falling at night, the close ups on Tilda Swinton's longing expression. That's where the movie shines. But the overall movie was lukewarm."
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,3,"I went in with fairly low expectations due to some of the reviews I had read, but I loved this. It took a minute to get used to hearing Almodovars dialogue in English, but once I locked in, I was having a great time. Feels like classic Almodovar - melodramatic and beautiful, emotional. The two lead performances are exquisite."
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,4,This movie was hilarious. Not sure if it was intentional. When Michelle walked in I was in stitches.
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,5,"My first review was downvoted for pith, so I‚Äôll expand here.

This movie is heavily marred by stilted, unsubtle dialogue from a dimension juuust adjacent to our own. Every character says exactly what they‚Äôre thinking, sometimes even narrating their current actions for no reason. It‚Äôs the kind of ridiculous character interaction that works well in something satirical like American Psycho or The Love Witch, but feels completely oblivious to its own absurdity here.

As a brief example, when the two leads first arrive at their rental, there is a shot that exists solely so Martha can say, ‚ÄúAccording to the map, we take the stairs here to reach our house.‚Äù You have a map‚Ä¶ of the house? And at no point in the plot is it necessary to know about these stairs or the map? And the very next shot is them taking the stairs to reach their house? Half the dialogue in this movie raises similar strings of questions. It feels like aliens wrote a serious drama after watching only soap operas.

edit: Early on there is a flashback to a house fire scene. If you can listen to the script in that scene and feel any emotion besides secondhand embarrassment then by all means stick around for the rest of the film"
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,6,"This really didn't work for me. I get that stilted dialogue is part of Almod√≥var's style, but the movie itself never gets weird enough or does anything interested enough to make the stilted dialogue feel like anything more than bad writing. And while it isn't explicitly a bad thing, the way everything unfolds in this movie is exactly as you would expect/exactly as you are told to expect by the movie, and I'm not saying every movie needs a twist but this one's general lack of true conflict just made it feel dull. Only other Almod√≥var film I've seen is Pain and Glory and I quite liked that one, so perhaps it's a translation issue for me"
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,7,"what I want to know is how realistic the pursuit of prosecution is ? I've been to Woodstock NY (looks almost nothing like depicted \[well most of the locations\] but anyway...) and it's a sleepy mountain town near the catskills. The ""broken windows policing"" of the LEO is laughable but I guess it adds drama ? 

I could see someone further down the socio-economic scale or a local dope fiend or indigent or countless otherr examples being investigated but really not even investigated, just written up and interviewed.

 really liked the movie though, I would rewatch it, a rarity for me. I've seen a majority of Pedro's films and have not been disappointed."
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,8,"Almodovar is one of my favorite directors. However this one just didn‚Äôt work for me at all. The stilted, arch dialogue was a big problem. And what was with that music score which seemed to have wandered in from a 1950s pulp melodrama? I suppose it was intentional but it was a bad choice. I did enjoy the bookstore bit at the end-the capper ‚ÄúNice!‚Äù got quite a big laugh from the audience at my screening.

I was hoping Almodovar‚Äôs first film in English shot in NY could be his own spin on a Woody Allen madcap comedy a la Anora. Maybe next time."
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,9,"Echoing what others have said, not one of this best, but also not the worst of what‚Äôs being shown in theaters. I think that the publicity on this will still talk about it positively due to the investment in the director."
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,10,"I was a bit confused at the ending.  Was the woman sitting with Ingrid in the lounge chairs on the patio the daughter (Michelle) or Martha?   The reason I ask is that as they were conversing, the face of the person speaking with Ingrid (whom I initially assumed was Michelle) appeared to morph into Martha, looking exactly like her.   Then, during their conversation, Ingrid refers to Michelle in the third person, as if the woman next to her wasn't Michelle.   

Any thoughts?"
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,11,Amazingly good movie.
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,12,Pretty crappy of Martha to have hid the fact that she had asked a previous friend to join her plan before asking Ingrid. Obviously this would create legal complications for Ingrid.
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,13,Is it a point that Martha didn't get suicide drug with her? And let Ingrid find it for her?
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,14,Pedro Almod√≥var's unique style and knack for heightened melodrama translate exceptionally well to the English language. This is a visually exquisite and profoundly moving meditation on the meaning of life and the acceptance of death. Stirringly scored and Tilda Swinton and Julianne Moore are both terrific.
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,15,Juan DIEGO not DIAGO
The Room Next Door,1i8m8ka,16,I bet if you're drunk this movie is comedy genius. Unfortunately I was sober
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,1,"So many aspects of this movie had me thinking: ""How does this exist?""
- A Pharrell biopic, but in Lego
- Possibly a legal nightmare in clearing so many brands, songs, and people to appear in this movie
- Weed smoke played off as ""PG Spray""
- Lego Pusha T deals Lego Drugs (if you're curious what Pharrell would have to say on this, watch [this video and skip to 2:15](https://youtu.be/9M9NexVR0-k?si=EpVxu31O3U81hPce)).

As a huge hip-hop fan, watching this movie was a treat. Also glad such a fun and inspiring movie exists for the younger generation today. 7/10."
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,2,"The funniest thing to me was that this movie used Blurred Lines as the song right before Pharrell begins to spread himself thin by doing too much, only for him to make his triumphant return with Get Lucky.

* Blurred Lines release date: March 27, 2013
* Get Lucky release date: April 19, 2013"
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,3,"Anyone catch that disclaimer at the end?

""Not everything in this film actually happened. For example, Pharrell never went to space"""
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,4,"there were lego blm protests in this movie and a white mom took her kids out of the theatre, there was like 10 minutes of movie left lol"
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,5,"This movie reminded me of two things:¬†


1. Late 90s - mid 00's Gwen Stefani was a MASSIVE late child/early teenage crush for me.


2. Hella Good is a goddamn banger of a song."
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,6,"I was keeping my eye on this thread to go up, and somehow STILL missed it lol! üôà Caught an advance screening earlier this month. Not sure if this is against sub rules for crew to comment on their own films, [but I worked on this as a concept artist](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAqsSTJPgdL/?igsh=dzJtZHRjNmVxaXhm) and am hella proud of having been part of it. ü•π Happy to answer any questions?

Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,7,More ambitious than Megapolis
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,8,"I just got back from seeing this tonight, and honestly I enjoyed the shit out of this. I will admit it‚Äôs the lego animation that gives this film life. If this was just a documentary about Pharrell, it would have been alright, but this was a very creative concept. Being a fan and knowing the timeIine and story was cut and pasted for an hour and a half movie, I still enjoyed every minute of it. 

Also, seeing Pusha T as a lego in a PG movie was hilarious."
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,9,"It bugs me that they added blocks to Snoop to make him taller instead of giving him Navi or Woody legs


As a LEGO fan &amp; a hip-hop fan, I loved it"
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,10,"Carl Sagan, Justin Timberlake, The Minions, Daft Punk, a handful of Crips in Snoop Dogg's entourage, Gwen Stefani, an exec at Sony, and, though only viewed briefly, MLK. All the stars were out tonight.

Honestly not sure what to feel about it, but I'm vaguely leaning positive? It's a vanity project (not meant as that strong of an insult, just not sure what else to call it) that hardly even suggests any legitimate hardships in Pharrell's rise to success until the final minutes, but damn if its existence isn't at least interesting enough on its own."
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,11,As someone who went into this only really knowing Pharrell the singer not really the producer I was blown away by how many songs he produced that were my childhood! I have so much more respect for him now and after watching this documentary it makes complete sense that Pharrell would do this in LEGO-form
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,12,"As I was driving home from this movie I started telling my friend that it felt like the opposite of Pink Floyd's The Wall.

Pharrell seemed to build his whole life from collaboration instead of shutting himself off from the world. He is a sponge for culture. Skate culture, science, religion, gangstas, fashion, television, punk, pop, hip hop he thrived from not shutting anything out, but he also seemed to be afraid to be on his own."
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,13,"I really enjoyed this movie! I love Legos and this was such a creative way for Pharrell to tell his life story. I grew up listening to a lot of the music that the Neptunes produced and those songs are still great many years later. 

I‚Äôm a huge fan of both No Doubt and Daft Punk so it was awesome seeing them in it. The robots came in to save the day! 

Something new that I learned was that Pharrell came up with the McDonald‚Äôs I‚Äôm Lovin‚Äô It jingle. I had no idea."
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,14,Spoilers for a documentary is wild lol
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,15,"A fantastic little bit of business here. Sure the timeline was off in a lot of cases, but they weren‚Äôt going for strict biography. Got surprisingly deep for a kids movie in the last half hour, the segment on Alright was the highlight of the whole film. The music video recreations alone make this worth it for the adults, but the messaging is good for kids as well. Also, Lego Pusha is hilarious in how cute and innocent he looks"
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,16,This was the most clever way to deliver a greatest hits album I‚Äôve ever seen. To me it worked on a few levels but most important children were taught lessons as Lego has always done and the most important lesson of all. Never give up.
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,17,"The lego trailer for Wicked was hilarious.

This movie was interesting but it was odd not having No Malice in it unless I missed him. Also definitely felt like it had bo direction, the pacing was all over the place.

I still had fun and would recommend it to anyone who likes hip hop.

I still cannot believe they got away with saying ""shit"" multiple times in a PG movie. And the PG spray was hilarious."
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,18,Keep in mind we are getting another self produced Pharrell Williams biopic musical next year called Atlantis
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,19,"I disliked all Lego movies I had seen before this, but enjoyed this one - maybe because I‚Äôm a history and music dude. I do build a lot of legos too, but the Lego movies have always been meh for me, so I walked into this expecting to be annoyed. lol

While it is a biopic, I love it for its general music history and I think anybody who loves hip-hop will for sure love this film even if Legos aren‚Äôt their thing. Seeing Pharrell shuffle through his influences on vinyl Lego pieces was cool - and a good nod to artists like Stevie and Aretha Franklin.   Him Being in the studio that was producing MJ‚Äôs Dangerous album was a great gem to know. The wrex in effect influence  he had was great to see how it happened - because we associate that song with 90‚Äôs hip-hop and Pharrell is so 2000‚Äôs, it really puts into perspective how long he‚Äôs been around and been influential to hip-hop and music culture in general. All the artists that he grew up with, went to school with, and worked with recently as well - it‚Äôs a great to see all of this together and told. As a hip-hop and music fan in general, this was gold. 

I grew up in the 2000‚Äôs so it was great to see the unfolding of Pharrell‚Äôs massive body of work and knowing the ins and outs of how hit records came to be and also, what could‚Äôve been. Like I know he made A LOT, but wow, this really made me think. Not to mention, there‚Äôs a lot that was left out - just look up a produced by Pharrell playlist on Spotify and you‚Äôll see. Hearing Pharrell talk about the merging of No Doubt and his hip-hop style was so cool to know generally for music. I had never thought of how Pharrell and No Doubt mirrors a little Run-DMC and Aerosmith, but it does (don‚Äôt cancel me for this comparison, simply saying it was a rock and hip-hop collab similarly to Run and Steven Tyler). Hearing how he made Frontin‚Äô for prince blew my brain because prince truly would‚Äôve been perfect for it.  There‚Äôs a lot of fun facts to learn and yet it‚Äôs nostalgic at the same time hearing all the songs I know. I really appreciated it for the history and thought how creative that he could do this to appeal to even more people and keep his relevance. Just like his music, this idea is ahead of its time 

Last thing i want to say is I discovered Pharrell/NERD playing NFL Fever 2002 on the original Xbox . Every time I played that game I thought ‚Äúthis shit goes too hard‚Äù and when Snoop Dog made that reference I was like ‚ÄúBRO THANK YOU‚Äùüôèüèæ 

My writing is all over the place but I had to come and share some thoughts. Thanks for reading üëç"
Piece by Piece,1g0z5z1,20,It was worth a watch for the novelty if nothing else
Saturday Night,1jr0qw5,1,"I hadn‚Äôt thought about this movie in years and yet it has lived rent-free in my mind since I was 13. This may have been the movie to teach me about tropes, really, the way that it so effectively uses all the familiar conspiracy thriller beats a la ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù got branded into my young mind. I was actually quite surprised to see when I looked it up on Letterboxd that people don‚Äôt like this movie. I rewatched it this week and, while obviously not perfect, I still got quite a nostalgic kick out of it. 

Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker, a truly early 2000s cast, not to mention Leslie Bibb who is currently having her White Lotus moment. It‚Äôs actually insane to think this was 25 years ago, she still looks fantastic. I also love that this movie is mostly about Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen beefing. You‚Äôve got Coach and the Manhunter himself pulling these strings and they just give me such great ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù vibes. 

As far as similar conspiracy thrillers go, maybe this isn‚Äôt the most unique one. But it is so specific to a time and place. I really loved the moment when the plethora of models walk into the Skulls party and Higher by Creed starts playing, and they basically play the song in full with lyrics. It‚Äôs no mystery why 13-year-old me latched onto this. Plus you‚Äôve got some Papa Roach, some Collective Soul, some Fatboy Slim. This just really takes me back to a simpler time. 

There‚Äôs definitely a fantasy element that probably played really well to me back then too. The fantasy of one day being accepted into the elites, all your money problems and unsure future plans suddenly secured. I loved the touch that when he‚Äôs taking money out of the ATM it says, ‚Äú$20,019.43‚Äù or something, implying that he wouldn‚Äôt even have been able to take out twenty dollars in the first place. Not just the fantasy of security, but also the idea that a 19-year-old could pull one over on a 200 year old secret society that has endless resources and surveillance. 

Overall, even knowing this is just a carbon copy of so many movies before it and since, this still hits for me. The soundtrack, the cast, the tropes, they just bring me right back. It‚Äôs a 7/10 for me. A movie above any other!"
Saturday Night,1jr0qw5,2,If y'all dont like this movie you can meet me in Liar's Hell
Saturday Night,1jr0qw5,3,"It's wild. I was randomly thinking about this film the other day. I only ever saw it once and like another redditors said its sort of been in the place of simultaneously something that I hardly think about but also which lives rent free in my mind.

I was thinking that they don't really make films like this anymore."
Saturday Night,1jr0qw5,4,This movie is such a male power fantasy.
Saturday Night,1jr0qw5,5,This movie lived on Starz when I was a kid. I watched it a million times just because it was the best thing on at midnight. I always wanted it to be better than it actually was though.
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,1,"fuuuuuck me i ugly cried so hard when older elliott was hugging chad - that scene DESTROYED ME

(also the penelope disick joke made me laugh so fucking hard)"
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,2,I loved the random bits of Future Lore that Old Elliott dropped like salmon being goneüò≠
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,3,"Saw it tonight and very much enjoyed it. I know this gets brought up a lot, but it's nice to watch a movie that isn't competing with Gone With the Wind for runtime. The dialogue impressed me in this movie. The characters actually talk like how young people talk, not like how some middle age screenwriter thinks they talk."
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,4,Did anyone else walk away thinking that this was ADULT Elliot's trip the whole time? I felt like it was adult Elliot processing her grief and trying to move on.
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,5,"Idk why but the PhD line was my favorite of the film. Younger Elliot looking so excited biting her nails like ok tell me, tell me, what do we have to look forward to. Older Elliot‚Äôs super impressed delivery like she just dropped the mic about their PhD. That was great."
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,6,"Love the screenplay.

My favorite thing about it is that older Elliott's #1 piece of advice to younger Elliott, which older Elliott imparts over and over again in every conversation is-- SAVOR THE SMALL MOMENTS WHILE THEY'RE HAPPENING BECAUSE NOTHING LASTS. It's why older Elliott tells younger Elliott to spend time with her family, her friends, enjoy the farm, etc. 

And at the end, we learn who older Elliott learned that advice from... she learned it from Chad. The same person she's trying to steer younger Elliott away from to save younger Elliott heartbreak. And in that final scene of the three of them together, older Elliott gets to do something we almost never get to do-- enjoy some wonderful thing knowing it's both wonderful and also the last time you'll get to enjoy it.

Despite the heartache and in fact BECAUSE OF IT, Chad taught older Elliott the most important lesson in her life and she gets one unexpected wonderful chance to put that lesson into action by seeing younger Chad again vibrant and healthy and really savoring that moment. The last moment of her innocence."
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,7,"This is my number two movie of the year. It's so good and that ending is a tear jerker. If you can only see one Aubrey Plaza movie this weekend, it's this one"
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,8,Sad I didn‚Äôt see a mention here of the Saiorse Ronan wall cause that was dope.
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,9,"Aubrey Plaza made me cry during that scene at the end. This was so so good, will definitely be a classic coming of age movie."
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,10,"Was really not expecting to like this as much as I did. Made me genuinely tear up, and the themes and natural conversation about life, its growing speed, and the tribulations that make us who we are hit such an insane chord with me. The performances too felt so naturalistic that I felt like I was l hanging out with these high schoolers in Canada (and a more relatable older version of one of them).

Chad‚Äôs mention of how we never know the last time we do something made me feel...well, feelings. What a wonderful little film, so glad I got to catch this in theaters.

SIDE NOTE: this makes for a fascinating companion piece with THE SUBSTANCE which I just watched yesterday. Similar themes in a weird way, completely different approaches."
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,11,Good movie. Tear jerker for sure. Justin Bieber scene was hilarious.
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,12,Aubrey plaza is special
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,13,"My favorite part of this was when Elliot sees Chad working at the farm, she smiles, but then he sees her and smiles and waves. Then she does the throat cut move, and he was just like ""Me?"""
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,14,"This is easily my favorite movie of the year, and theres been a lot this year that I‚Äôve loved. This movie really connected with me on an emotional level and had me bawling by the end. Go see this movie with someone you love!"
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,15,I like they didn‚Äôt explain how Chad can see old Elliott. Allow her to touch him. It‚Äôs kind of like telling audience to live at the moment.
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,16,"Maisie Stella is SO good in this. She has so much charisma on screen, crazy that this is her first movie."
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,17,"The lines that were dropped in this movie were incredibly powerful. The exchange between Elliot and her mom about what it was like once she was able to start crawling and walking on her own‚Ä¶ balling.

Then hearing Chad fucking dies‚Ä¶ and knowing she‚Äôll still pursue it because ‚Äúfuck it! I love him!‚Äù‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt stop me from balling for the next 10 minutes 

If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that I had seen a similar ‚Äúconvuluted but deeply existential‚Äù plot with EEAAO, this might‚Äôve honestly been one of my favorite films of the decade. Instead, it rounds up my personal top 10 so far this year."
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,18,"What an absolute joy of a film. I watched it last night and I couldn't stop laughing.

The lead reminded me so much of Chloe Grace Moritz it was distracting but I think CGM would have been too noticeable and the movie wouldn't have worked as well.

But goddamn I wasn't expecting the mild sci-fi aspect of the film and just...I cannot get over how great this was."
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,19,Can't believe I walked into Gen-Z Arrival
My Old Ass,1fqd0hm,20,"Nice character-driven, coming-of-age dramedy that made me laugh and sad all in the same hour and a half. It's not really made to hit you right in between the eyes, rather it's reflective and a study in the last days of careless youth so to speak before going off and truly growing up.

My only complaint is that Maddie Ziegler wasn't in more scenes haha (she was great in the director's prior movie The Fallout). If something that minor is my complaint then that's a good thing. 

As a side note, I was horrified to hear about the stalker Maisy Stella had to deal with a few years ago. I'm so glad she currently appears to be doing well."
The Outrun,1g0z62k,1,"I enjoyed the movie thought it was perhaps the best depiction of alcoholism I‚Äôve seen in a movie, though I don‚Äôt know what was in second. 

Saoirse Ronan remains at the top of her field. She hard carries this movie."
The Outrun,1g0z62k,2,"Incredibly bleak but beautiful film. My heart absolutely dropped after she'd been beaten up and her ex comes to the hospital to see her, for her to say ""shall we get a drink?"". Audible groans in my viewing. 
 
I find it interesting that Rona's way of dealing with her demons was to essentially imprison herself on a desolate island. The film does a good job of presenting it as this idyllic land of freedom, no more societal pressures or gossiping people, while still ramming home that you are on a small rock being battered by the elements, with no one around you, not a tree in sight. If the only way to overcome your addiction is to maroon yourself somewhere, are you really free from that addiction? I almost felt like I was watching people in a prison yard, celebrating that it was bigger than their cell. I suppose addiction for many people is a form of prison sentence,"
The Outrun,1g0z62k,3,Saoirse was great of course but I felt this movie was a bit too long.
The Outrun,1g0z62k,4,"There's a lot of showing rather than telling, which I appreciate with a topic like this. The scenery is gorgeous, but the pacing is a little slow at times. I realize this is deliberate, and almost meditative at times, but my husband was a little bored, and I was getting there. 

Saoirse is incredible, as always - truly one of the finest actors of her generation."
The Outrun,1g0z62k,5,Let Ronan cook
The Outrun,1g0z62k,6,"Gorgeously shot movie, makes me miss Scotland so bad."
The Outrun,1g0z62k,7,"Question about the end - maybe I missed something obvious or am completely misinterpreting.

Is the film implying that Rona has manic episodes like her dad? There is a scene near the end when she enthusiastically monologues about seaweed and her mum looks increasingly uncomfortable.

Then in the final scene, the bits where Rona is on the beach conducting the waves is intercut with flashbacks of her dad having a manic episode where he smashes the windows during a gale."
The Outrun,1g0z62k,8,"I saw this last week and absoltuely loved Saoirse's performance, but couldn't help wondering how much I'd have liked it without the constant nature-fun-facts-as-allegories-for-recovery voiceovers"
The Outrun,1g0z62k,9,"The film's most resonant aspect (for me) was the link between dance music and the undulating pulse of nature, and their function as healing mechanisms. There is a reference to a transfer of energy. Energy from the waves is transferred into the rock for example. Healing trauma is like this, you cannot get rid of it, but you can transform it.   
The film was therapeutic for me. I grew up with a sister suffering from schizophrenia, and a religious family who thought praying the demons out of her would help. I was scared af all the time as a child. When I became a teen I took ecstasy and was drawn to the hard house and techno clubs. Drowning out the ""self"" through drugs and assimilating into a crowd as a way to unburden...before I had the insight to know I was suffering.   
The insight is key I think? And that only comes through isolating from (not assimilating into) the crowd. Doing the inner work.  
Later on in the film, Saoirse understands or rediscovers what she had always known. That nature, like techno, has a rhythm. This rhythm can be experienced and used as a healing mechanism for transferring energy. Some people dance for the joy of dancing and some people dance because their lives depend on it...to release something. The scenes of her composing nature and dancing sober in the hut, were Saoirse recognising this perhaps. Like somatic release or something."
The Outrun,1g0z62k,10,"Saoirse Ronan may take it this year.

I‚Äôm seeing Anora tomorrow so we‚Äôll wait and see what Mikey Madison‚Äôs performance is made of.

But right now I think Saoirse might sneak up on people with this. By far and away the best performance of her career so far."
The Outrun,1g0z62k,11,I‚Äôm wondering if the dog is ok? She went missing halfway through the movie and is never seen again and the dad is away too? Is that in the book?
The Outrun,1g0z62k,12,"Trying to recover is hard anywhere but I felt like the beautiful Orkney Islands had to be a vacation compared to some of the rougher situations out there. The hospital I did rehab at was in the lower east side, early 2000‚Äôs and we weren‚Äôt allowed outside. Smoking in ine room was the only socializing. No headphones allowed. It was very grim. Her recovery looked like a beach vacation!"
The Outrun,1g0z62k,13,"Im a big fan of this, in large part just for soaking in the views of Scotland. Saoirse is of course fantastic"
The Outrun,1g0z62k,14,Some overly flowery narration and on-the-nose symbolism aside this was really good. Ronan nailed the devastatingly cringe-worthy nature of sloppy drunkenness.
The Outrun,1g0z62k,15,"enjoyed the vibe of the movie a lot. amazing scenery. i always considered the isle of skye my soul place in europe but i have to check out orkney now, the rawness is breathtaking.

i'm lucky enough to be able to indulge in debauchery without the addiction ""gene"" but know many who can't. so the movie really hit close to home, especially from the perspective of the hopeless friend/relative. also appreciating it for showing alcohol(ism) for the dangerous, deeply socially rooted substance it is.

some of the themes / visual cues as well as the narration are a bit heavy handed. pacing is not great, film a bit too long. the disjointed narrative fits the subject matter perfectly though. 

saoirse is simply amazing, she should get all the awards for this."
The Outrun,1g0z62k,16,"the movie was absolutely phenomenal! the first half of the movie felt very disconnected and confusing (perhaps to reflect the frenzied state of Rona), but the latter half was no less than breathtaking! the whole movie felt like a poem out of Wordsworth's pages and I was really yearning for that kind of a romantic whiff! my favorite aspect of the movie was the symbol of her hair. at the peak of her alcoholism, its pink (just like the neon lights at a rave), and then she thinks that bringing it to her natural color will help solve her issues (it doesn't, she relapses). Ultimately, she finds a sense of solace and rejuvenation only in the nature and traditions of Papay -- and she realizes that, to find herself is to embrace the spirit of nature. so, she dyes her hair red, the color of the flames which essentially freed her during the festival.   
10/10!"
The Outrun,1g0z62k,17,"I was very confused as to how she had money and was supporting herself at all. She worked for the bird rescue group briefly, it seemed, but that was enough to float her rent and food and cigerettes for her whole isolated island stay?"
The Outrun,1g0z62k,18,"Can someone please clarify the scene in the movie for me when Rona came home and the house was empty and she went upstairs and there was a note that said 'I'm sorry' and she got upset, smashed some things, and found a bottle of wine wrapped in a towel in a suitcase, and started drinking again?"
The Outrun,1g0z62k,19,"just finished it. i liked it! loved it? i wouldn‚Äôt say so. ronan is always fantastic though, i honestly watched it just for her. she‚Äôll always be one of the greats of ALL generations in my book.

anyways back to the movie, i loved the flashback scenes. some of them were pretty emotional and addiction doesn‚Äôt even hit close to home for me. i think it‚Äôs because the director/writer does a pretty great job of latching you on to rona and root for her through her sobriety so the flashbacks end up being just heartbreaking to watch. the scene that cracked me to shed a couple tears is when she went home to mom completely smashed and even with her tyranny through the house her mom was still taking care of her. that part touched me.

anyways, i do think the pacing was a bit off, (in this case i think it was slightly overtimed) but im glad i watched it!"
The Outrun,1g0z62k,20,"That line where drunkenness goes from 'cute' to 'not cute, not even a little bit' is so well depicted in this film.  It's so clear to bystanders and impossible to sense from the drunk person's perspective."
A Different Man,zzvg5y,1,"My biggest takeaway reading through this is that you have a joy of movies that really comes through in your comments. It really comes off that you find something interesting to latch onto in everything you see with only a few exceptions for the ones at the bottom of the list. And even then, it feels like everything is given a chance.

I really enjoyed this list. I hope 2023 brings you many more exciting trips to the cinema."
A Different Man,zzvg5y,2,Wait a second... which pinocchio? At a 6/10 I'm unsure if u dislike  the del Toro one or liked the Disney one haha.
A Different Man,zzvg5y,3,"I‚Äôm surprised you thought **Mrs Harris Goes To Paris** only deserves 5/10.

Did you not watch **Everything Everywhere All At Once,** or did I miss it?

Edit: found it - 8/10"
A Different Man,zzvg5y,4,"Really interesting thoughts, but the rating the stood out to me the most was Blonde - 8/10"
A Different Man,zzvg5y,5,"This guy is singlehandedly keeping cinema alive. Kudos to you. I can't afford to see more than a handful of films a year so I have to be very picky, but I would love to see every one released if I could afford it."
A Different Man,zzvg5y,6,Wow. Can I ask why you only gave Flee a 4/10?
A Different Man,zzvg5y,7,"I thought Bullet Train was a really fun movie. Not amazing or anything, but I had a lot of fun watching it."
A Different Man,zzvg5y,8,"I just wanted to let you know that I look forward to this post every year. It will be a 104 movie year for me, catching I Wanna Dance With Somebody today."

I think you mean 14/10, movie of the decade."
A Different Man,zzvg5y,14,"When I saw Worst Person in the World in theaters, so many uncomfortable guys with sobbing dates when the credits rolled. I got teary eyed myself though"
A Different Man,zzvg5y,15,"Someone who's seen Ramona! I still have to catch it but your high praise will finally push me to watch it. I wasn't enamoured by the trailer. 

I agree that Official Competition is Penelope Cruz's best performance to date. 

I read the book that Simple Passion is based on. It's only about 80 pages long so I wondered how they would make a film out of it. A shame that's it nowhere near as good as the book. Happening is also based on an auto fiction by the same author, Annie Ernaux."
A Different Man,zzvg5y,16,"I think I saw like three movies in theaters this year, and the only one I remember was Morbius. I saw it with some buddies and it was probably the best movie experience I've had in a long, long time. The movie wasn't good in any way but we had so much fun because we knew it was bad

I haven't watched it again, but one of the guys I saw it with did and he said it was super boring and had nothing redeemable about it

So I guess that's my movie experience for this year"
A Different Man,zzvg5y,17,Sonic 2 is 10/10 and you're not gonna change my mind. üò§
A Different Man,zzvg5y,18,"Well that's impressive!

How cool was it after the pandemic to be able to go to the movies all the time? Love it."
A Different Man,zzvg5y,19,"I'm a cinephile, but I'll tip my hat to a true master.  Overall, I felt your rankings were spot on, and your love for film shines through your brief synopsis reviews.   I'm not surprised that you ranked Babylon near the top of your list, when I watched it I had mixed feelings about the film, but several days later I can't stop thinking about it.   For people who watch a lot of films, Babylon was the apex of grand Hollywood film making, a tribute to cinema and the art form, but casual film goers will most likely get put off by the films vulgarity.

I'm going to check out some of the films on this list.  Overall I felt this was a crummy year for film, but now I might see some movies that will change my mind."

None of the other films you mentioned have anything close in the script."
Successor,1jr0qw5,1,"I hadn‚Äôt thought about this movie in years and yet it has lived rent-free in my mind since I was 13. This may have been the movie to teach me about tropes, really, the way that it so effectively uses all the familiar conspiracy thriller beats a la ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù got branded into my young mind. I was actually quite surprised to see when I looked it up on Letterboxd that people don‚Äôt like this movie. I rewatched it this week and, while obviously not perfect, I still got quite a nostalgic kick out of it. 

Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker, a truly early 2000s cast, not to mention Leslie Bibb who is currently having her White Lotus moment. It‚Äôs actually insane to think this was 25 years ago, she still looks fantastic. I also love that this movie is mostly about Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen beefing. You‚Äôve got Coach and the Manhunter himself pulling these strings and they just give me such great ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù vibes. 

As far as similar conspiracy thrillers go, maybe this isn‚Äôt the most unique one. But it is so specific to a time and place. I really loved the moment when the plethora of models walk into the Skulls party and Higher by Creed starts playing, and they basically play the song in full with lyrics. It‚Äôs no mystery why 13-year-old me latched onto this. Plus you‚Äôve got some Papa Roach, some Collective Soul, some Fatboy Slim. This just really takes me back to a simpler time. 

There‚Äôs definitely a fantasy element that probably played really well to me back then too. The fantasy of one day being accepted into the elites, all your money problems and unsure future plans suddenly secured. I loved the touch that when he‚Äôs taking money out of the ATM it says, ‚Äú$20,019.43‚Äù or something, implying that he wouldn‚Äôt even have been able to take out twenty dollars in the first place. Not just the fantasy of security, but also the idea that a 19-year-old could pull one over on a 200 year old secret society that has endless resources and surveillance. 

Overall, even knowing this is just a carbon copy of so many movies before it and since, this still hits for me. The soundtrack, the cast, the tropes, they just bring me right back. It‚Äôs a 7/10 for me. A movie above any other!"
Successor,1jr0qw5,2,If y'all dont like this movie you can meet me in Liar's Hell
Successor,1jr0qw5,3,"It's wild. I was randomly thinking about this film the other day. I only ever saw it once and like another redditors said its sort of been in the place of simultaneously something that I hardly think about but also which lives rent free in my mind.

I was thinking that they don't really make films like this anymore."
Successor,1jr0qw5,4,This movie is such a male power fantasy.
Successor,1jr0qw5,5,This movie lived on Starz when I was a kid. I watched it a million times just because it was the best thing on at midnight. I always wanted it to be better than it actually was though.
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,1,"Movie was way better than I expected, it was stupid but in fun way. Like that ""im in metal storm too!"" ""You liar there is no metal storm 2 yet!"" lol. Also I'm biased because I'm in Sydney so it was a bit nuts seeing parts of cbd, if there was a single car crash in the city it would be breaking news over here lol, just wish they had some scenes in the train for more Sydney-ness. Over all 8/10! üëç"
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,2,Jason Momoa (Mamoa?) absolutely killing the sci-fi genre with Dune and Metal Storm
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,3,This was the cutest romantic subplot in an action movie since I don't know when
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,4,As a rom com lover I really enjoyed Gosling‚Äôs character confusing Notting Hill and Pretty Woman.
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,5,"Loved it. Incredibly fun, Gosling is an all-time charisma and charm machine. His comedic abilities are extremely rare in an A-list serious actor. He really is one of the funniest actor's I've ever seen, and he effortlessly carries this movie. The action is clearly crafted by someone who truly loves stunt work and has imagined various scenarios for years, and is finally able to make it into reality. I really hope people see this in theaters, because it's exactly the kind of movie so many people have been wanting. It feels like it's been years since I've seen a movie like this, and everyone is on their A game in it."
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,6,Ryan Gosling screaming at Aaron Taylor-Johnson about carbs and glucose legitimately was one of the funniest parts of this whole movie hahaha
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,7,I'M A PICKLE
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,8,"My favourite joke was Emily Blunt's character suddenly revealing herself to be a great fighter out of nowhere.¬†¬†


That and ""It was like a sushi train!"""
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,9,Every time the fake Dune song played I was waiting for the beat to drop only to be teased
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,10,Winston Duke shouting ‚ÄúDWAYNE THE ROCK JOHNSON‚Äù as he heaves the female stunt double over the counter killed me.
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,11,"You can tell the director, who used to be a stuntman, and the stunt team had a blast doing this movie."
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,12,David Leitch is one of the few directors today giving us big theatrical action movies with an A list star as the lead. Something that was way more popular in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs but now is becoming more and more rare. ¬†Hope he keeps pumping out stuff like this and Bullet Train.
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,13,Every time he would give the dog increasingly  specific commands in French sent me. My favorite gag in the movie.
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,14,Metal Storm turned out way fucking better than Rebel Moon.
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,15,"I guess they were imitating Dune lol. Especially the Jason Mamoa cameo which made me laugh out loud.   

Overall a fun action romantic comedy. All the movie references were fun too. Gosling and Blunt had great chemistry."
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,16,"I've seen Drive Away Dolls, Love Lies Bleeding *and* Challengers this year but Ryan Gosling exiting the water in that tight t shirt with that cover version of I Was Made For Lovin You playing was the horniest cinema moment of the year."
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,17,"""I'm in MetalStorm too!""
""You liar, we're shooting MetalStorm 1!"""
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,18,God damn Emily Blunt looks good in a romper
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,19,Hearing Ryan scream in like autotune when he's stabbed with the pen made me laugh more than it should've lol
The Fall Guy,1cix93k,20,"Best joke in the whole film was the guy in the alien suit nodding along to Colt's megaphone speech and then him saying ""I fell in love with my wife's sister"" with the auto-tuned alien voice"
Smile 2,1juhagr,1,The adverts make it seem like the same movie as Accountant 2 and they both have John Bernthal in them to boot
Smile 2,1juhagr,2,"The pool collapse is the key part of the ad that's always playing on Disney Plus since Snow White came out. It starts with Malek saying ""My wife was murdered"", which forces me to yell ""by a man in a yellow sweater!"" at my TV"
Smile 2,1juhagr,3,"This is a solid Dad movie. Not incredible or groundbreaking, but entertaining revenge action films are always fun."
Smile 2,1juhagr,4,Sounds not brilliant but eminently watchable.

Smile 2,1juhagr,7,Man Rami and Sam Esmail need to get back together. How was Mr. Robot such a masterpiece yet neither can come close to the highs again?
Smile 2,1juhagr,8,"I wrote this elsewhere but:

I really enjoyed it! The cat-mouse energy was good and I liked a lot of the storyline choices it made. I also liked how, while obviously not realistic, it made an everyday looking guy the hero. Rami Malek doesn‚Äôt look like an action hero normally but he really pulled it off here. His acting when he finds out his wife is dead and the aftermath is VERY good. I also think it has some really funny moments where it‚Äôs like ‚Äúofc he‚Äôs doing this, he‚Äôs not actually CIA trained lol.‚Äù Also some FUN surprises in this too with some casting twists. 

I think the dad and old man audience is gonna enjoy this one a lot lol"
Smile 2,1juhagr,9,"&gt;‚ÄúAn aggressively competent spy thriller that has less use for logic than its lead actor does for his smile...‚Äù

Take a bow for that one, Mr. Ehrlich."
Smile 2,1juhagr,10,I liked how even though he's the main character he's kind of a piece of shit. He does very questionable things around civilians in this movie.
Smile 2,1juhagr,11,"This is honestly better than I expected, like 55 metacritic isn't good, but at least it isn't terrible like I imagined from the trailers. I might check it out since it's a great cast"
Smile 2,1juhagr,12,"I enjoyed this a lot. I especially liked Laurence Fishburne‚Äôs character and the cat-and-mouse game that ensued. 

I must have watched the trailer a thousand times, but I felt like the movie still had a lot of surprises up its sleeve. 

Not as intelligent as Black Bag, but very fun."
Smile 2,1juhagr,13,"I don‚Äôt understand how or why this movie got made in this day and age. Looks generic and predictable, but more damning it looks like a movie nobody asked for, a movie people might have seen 20 years ago when there were fewer options. Watchable? Maybe. Forgettable? Definitely, immediately."
Smile 2,1juhagr,14,I just love to burne some fish.
Smile 2,1juhagr,15,"Was a supporting artiste on this, part of the crowd outside St Pancras station running away, hoping I made it on screen!"
Smile 2,1juhagr,16,"Went to the early viewing of this a this past Saturday- over all it was a good movie, not great. I would‚Äôve benefited from an extra 20 min to flush things out, let them grow, and make it a stronger game of chase, catch me if you can, by showcasing Charles characters skills more. Lots of neat ideas; characters with lots of skills that don‚Äôt fully get utilized; main characters that are suppose to be important but ultimately fell to the side. Overall I‚Äôd give it a generous 3/5 cause Rami and Laurence are awesome in general."
Smile 2,1juhagr,17,"Does Jon Bernthal at any point say ""no, no, no, no, no, no, noooo""?"
Smile 2,1juhagr,18,[Here's one I wrote for it](https://awakeinthedark.com/2025/04/the-amateur)

Smile 2,1juhagr,20,"Yeah, about what I expected. I saw this at an advance screening.

The main thing is that it‚Äôs overlong. Seeing this so shortly after seeing black bag really makes you realize this.

It was actually better than I thought it was going to be, though. I thought it was gonna be a fun bad movie"

Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,1,"‚ÄúFuck Hoppy‚Äù
-My whole audience"
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,2,Ben might be the dumbest person I‚Äôve ever seen
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,3,"Shockingly good for a movie a lot thought was destined to be awful, but to be fair I think a lot of that was not helped by that horrendous trailer that‚Äôs been playing for what feels like years now. James Mcavoy is a star plain and simple this does not work without him and his facial expressions do so much work in keeping that long anxious tension. I loved how it also wasn‚Äôt afraid to be darkly comic and carve its own identity and actually went somewhere. Overall a solid 7.5 nothing groundbreaking but really well made and I‚Äôd recommend."
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,4,"Unrelated to the film at large but can I just say it's hilarious that most actors get super jacked for Marvel roles, whereas McAvoy gets super jacked for non-Marvel roles üòÖ"
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,5,"A good thriller, elevated by the cast

- Even though I've watched the trailer way too many times involuntarily, it's still pretty well-paced and entertaining movie 
- James McAvoy is the standout and he's having the time of his life
- The red flags keep happening but Ben &amp; Louise ignoring or letting it go just increases the tension
- The whole tyre scene just culminates all the tension. I really thought Ben would die from the fall because Paddy let go of the ladder
- 3rd act is very fun a although logic flies out the window a bit
- Louise actually deals with the situation very well and hurts Paddy and co. the most 
- The kid who played Ant had a very tough job to drive the plot without any speaking and he nailed it. Giving him the final kill was justified.


Solidly directed and well acted makes this a very enjoyable thrill ride."
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,6,The cotton-eye Joe scene was actually pretty tense in the movie.¬†
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,7,James Mcavoy hasn‚Äôt missed on a role
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,8,"....OK Agnes, I'll give you shit for still being weridly attached to a stuffed animal at age 11, but the bloodying her thigh as an excuse to get her mom alone was possibility the smartest thing I've seen a kid do in a movie lately.

While it could be argued that the third act was actionized to appeal more to American audiences, it also suits because the type of Scandinavian politeness the original was specifically criticizing really isn't an American thing- in fact, in most American culture (IE not just in internet memes about guns), it's considered FAR more impolite to be an impolite host than guest (IE remember the internet outrage at the apparently Swedish norm of not feeding friends your kid brings over because you didn't expect them)."
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,9,This was so much better than I thought it was going to be. Highly recommend seeing it if you haven‚Äôt.
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,10,"This was significantly better than the marketing made it seem.

McAvoy is scarily good in this.

I actually preferred the third act of this film over the original (I have, very mixed feelings about the original‚Äôs ending honestly)."
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,11,Mcavoy delivered over and over on being unsettling
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,12,"The movie itself is pretty good but I am really loving the reactions in here.
If the director wanted to cover toxic masculinity they nailed it based on what I am reading.
The amount of Billy Badasses in here saying they would just kill with no hesitation is astounding. Same with all the ‚Äúthe dad is a pussy‚Äù type comments."
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,13,"Ant was a boy in the beginning of this movie. And by the end, he became a man

Damn did he go fucking wild on killing Paddy*"
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,14,"I was out of town and went to a different theatre and the screen was so dark but during the scenes with the photo albums.. I didn‚Äôt understand. Was McAvoy‚Äôs girlfriend a former child he stole? 

What happened to the other families?"
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,15,The boy who played Ant was so good.
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,16,Man if you don‚Äôt take your ass to build a bear workshop and leave hoppy ass in that house üòÇ. No way we‚Äôre going back for that
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,17,"Scoot McNairy really has the ""loveable but incredibly frustrating to watch husband"" market really cornered."
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,18,Good movie about the pressures of dancing. James McAvoy looked so beefed up I thought he was gaining muscle just by breathing.
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,19,"If this makes me a terrible person, then so be it.

But I would have kept going when homeboy threw Ant into the pond. Obviously I'd alert the authorities once we reached safety  

I would just have to live with that guilt and risk my daughter hating me the rest of her life. No way I would have re-exposed my family to those psychopaths"
Speak No Evil,1ffjnld,20,"This had no business being as funny as it was.

Really, really glad that they left out the misery porn from the original in favor of a more easily digestible ending. Pretty good movie that will most likely be remembered for James McAvoy‚Äôs performance."
The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,14pz03b,1,"Although I know the history; I still feel this will be a compelling, and well done movie."
The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,14pz03b,2,"I'll be interesting to see how Nolan recreated the actual test without CGI (or so it's claimed).

Personally, I reckon he shot practical footage in full-scale (probably lots of TNT or something similar) and then combined tthis with miniature shots using VFX. I'd imagine it would be hard to create a realistic looking explosion from practical effects alone.

(so not 100% CG free, but still grounded in real elements)"
The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,14pz03b,3,Very interesting. Thank you!
The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,14pz03b,4,remind me! tomorrow.

Just like I did visiting the Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas."

The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,1,Everyone in this movie is distractingly hot. Eiza Gonzalez might be the most attractive person I've ever seen. Alan Ritchson is jacked to a level that I didn't even know was possible. Henry Cavill is still Henry Cavill.
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,2,"If you‚Äôre looking for Nazi kills as slick as the dialogue. This is a fine Guy Ritchie film

If you are looking for deep character depth of an insane but true WWII story? This is also a Guy Ritchie film.

I must say too, but I want to see Alan Ritchson in more things. Not only were his Nazi kills the most badass since The Bear Jew, but he was hilarious.¬†"
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,3,"On the one hand, what a performance from Eiza Gonzalez. She carries the movie, in my opinion. On the other hand, that was the worst Churchill that ever Churchilled!"
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,4,"Winston Churchill at the end ‚Äúwhat is this, some kind of Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare?‚Äù"
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,5,"Alan Ritchson is the best Nazi Hunter since the Bear Jew

Also holy fucking shit Eiza Gonzales 

Super solid movie, middle dragged on a while but the nazi killing business was great. Very solid movie"
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,6,"I get that it's a mindless kill fest, but damn the Nazis are portrayed as cartoonishly incompetent. 

Even the big bad Hugo Stiglitz never posed any real threat - pretty sure Marjorie could've killed him with her hidden gun in the sex dungeon, seeing that every single Nazi is always caught off guard when a gun is pulled on them. 

Heron should've had his heroic sacrifice when caught rigging the power station, but nope - cartoonishly incompetent professional soldiers don't stand a chance 3 vs 1.

Guy Ritchie's signature style is also nowhere to be seen, but at least we have the Gentlemen series this year. 

6.5/10 for me personally. I'm sure Cavill would be put to better use if somehow we ever get a the Man from UNCLE sequel."
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,7,"i kind of admire that at the end it mentions that the lead girl and cavils character got married after the mission but i dont think they even say words to each other in the film, glad they didnt shoehorn a romance sideplot‚Ä¶besides ritchison trying to fuck everybody"
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,8,"Thoroughly enjoyed the film but I left wanting more. This feels more Dirty Dozen-ish than it does Inglourious Basterds. Since it‚Äôs based off a true story (saying that generously) I know they couldn‚Äôt go too crazy with it but if it was 15-20 minutes longer, to give some characters more spotlight, I would be much happier.

Plus Alan Ritchson is fucking giant, I‚Äôll watch whatever he‚Äôs in."
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,9,"Ritchson fighting in that hallway with the arrow was brutal and awesome. Lots of great set pieces, fun performances. Guy Ritchie was my favorite director as a teen and now 20 years later I‚Äôm really digging his recent filmography"
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,10,Hey Hollywood? If you are listening please make more movies with Henry Cavill and Alan Richson just hamming it up killing Nazis. That was the best popcorn movie I've seen in a minute
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,11,Guy Ritchie been on a hot streak
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,12,"rag tag team

fighting nazis 

sounds like its been done before"
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,13,"Ya know, I've got no real qualms with this movie. It's fun enough and not boring and the cast is great and really hot. But I wish I could say it did anything for me. It's certainly not the hoot 'n holler fest you want out of this kind of rambunctious and it's a curious choice to go so hard in this direction when this type of movie has honestly already been done to perfection.

The main problem is that the story this is based on has our heroes shacked up in a fishing boat for 75% of the movie. It leaves a lot on the shoulders of the casino owner and the actress, and they're great, but that plotline is all tension and sexiness and I just don't get the feeling Ritchie is as good with that stuff as this movie needs. The coy conversations between Hugo Stieglitz and Marjorie are really low energy and mostly amount to a bunch of weird fox metaphors and awkward pauses, it's just not fun or sexy. 

The cast itself is full of extremely charismatic and attractive people, and for that this movie is afforded some charm. I do wish it were better written, like had funnier dialogue, because as it stands now all the comedy basically comes from Cavill calling people ""old boy"" and well timed explosions. They're all having fun, but I'm not quite feeling the fun. I love Alan Ritchson but it's wild to cast Blue Mountain State kid who is currently playing American Sherlock Hulk as a member of British Special Forces then surround him with all British actors. And he sells the shit out of it, but who uses a bow and arrow on a narrow sea ship? 

The action is fine. This should be a movie that has me clapping and laughing with rhe violence, but it's just not that. Most of the action is boiled down to nonchalant silencer kills or just mowing baddies down with automatic weapons, which is fine, but in a post Wick world it's boring. There's no good hand to hand combat outside the Ritchson ship scene and there's really only two big action setpieces in this two hour runtime. Just not enough of the good stuff to make up for the mediocre writing. It's an interesting tonal experiment because Tarantino was able to mix the exploitation with the horrors so well, but in this movie whenever someone is outwardly racist or you see something awful it actually feels out of place despite this movie being about Nazis. I'm surprised this is rated R because it didn't feel like it took advantage of that at all. 

This is Guy Ritchie's sixth movie in five years, his next one already has a release date and I'd imagine there would have been more if not for Covid. Been following this guy's career since I saw Snatch in theaters when I was 12. I'll always be there for whatever he's cooking because sometimes he'll surprise me, but IMO RocknRolla was his last great movie and those days just might be over. 5/10 on this one. It's not bad or unwatchable, but it's really nothing to write home about.

The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,14,Hundreds of people involved in making this film and not one of them thought to point out that not a single character encounters an obstacle. Jesus.
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,15,"Didn't love it, honestly.

I don't have any problem with the component parts, mostly. It just didn't quite seem to come together for me; I felt the whole time like it was trying too hard, if that makes any sense. Like someone was working off a checklist.

Action scenes are pretty important for a movie like this. I thought they were well-directed and well-shot, but not well-scripted. It's fine to have the heroes be invincible super-soldiers who mow down endless hordes of enemies, but virtually none of the fighting ever felt like it had any stakes: the bad guys always just instantly died. Even if I know that the good guys are going to ultimately win, there should be a little tension in any action scene: will someone be injured and unable to continue? Will a named character perhaps die? Will the heroes be prevented from achieving their immediate goal and have to change their plan on the fly?

I thought the parts where Heron got found planting the bomb and where Marjorie got discovered and captured were good at setting up that kind of tension. I really didn't know how things would turn out for either of those characters. The action scenes could have used some tension like that. (I wasn't super-satisfied with how either of those were resolved in the end, though.)

Really disliked Rory Kinnear as Churchill. And having the entire British military leadership recommending that the UK surrender and agree to a Nazi occupation government struck me as a bit ridiculous. That didn't really happen, did it? I guess it's meant to play into this idea of Churchill as the lone anti-Hitler figure standing up to the pro-appeasement British establishment, but it just strikes me as taking the Churchill-mythologising too far.

I quite liked Alan Ritchson and I mostly liked Henry Cavill and Til Schweiger. The Hayes and Freddy characters (Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Henry Golding) didn't feel very fleshed out."
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,16,"...I really wish I liked it...But it felt like a garbage film. 

1)too much planning, not enough actually doing shit.   
2)your investment in the characters is due to their cartoonist quality, but you hardly see that capitalized on and it's mostly exposition that trys to be clever but isn't. They really want their characters to have depth in some moments while not ever earning it.  
3)the evil german hardly feels like a threat....""lets have a DARK nazi part""...jfc  
4)worst Churchill i've seen

5)more muscle Swedish man"
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,17,"Even though there was a real life romance between Gus and Marjorie, I'm glad it wasn't shoehorned into the movie.

It would've distracted from it, added unnecessary runtime and kinda taken away from Gonzalez's constant badassery."
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,18,"I wanna say this is the best Nazi killing movie since Inglourious Basterds, but Sisu came out last year and that was pretty fun also."
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,19,I‚Äôm a simple man. I see Alan Ritchson stabbing nazis repeatedly and I‚Äôm happy.
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,1c7lc2b,20,This movie kicked ass. The second best movie of 2024 thus far. 86/100
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,1,"I like that the film shows you that reaching the mountaintop doesn't always mean the end, and how you're not guaranteed a happy ending. It's honestly a fresh take on what otherwise would've been a decent sports underdog biopic."
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,2,"Don't feel bad for Barry Jenkins his director-for-hire job won't make a billion dollars. Instead, go see this movie where he had an actual creative hand in it."
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,3,We need more Brian Tyree Henry in movies please
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,4,"Just left the theater. Excellent performance by Ryan Destiny and Brian Tyree Henry. Pacing was a little off to me but it was a solid story. It didn't feel like they dove into anything too deeply though. Like her relationship with Zay, father and mother. Or the equal pay part. Pretty much kept the main thing the main thing. Having been a fan just before the 2016 Olympics, I was just excited to see her story told."
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,5,"I didn‚Äôt expect to like it as much as I did. It still follows the biopic formula but it follows Claressa after what should have been the climax of the film. It asks a very relatable question, ‚Äúwhat happens when your dream isn‚Äôt paying the bills?‚Äù We don‚Äôt get a fulfilling answer but it hit hard to watch someone else go through that emotional journey."
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,6,"Saw this on Mystery Movie Monday. I liked it a lot. Tough weekend for it to come out tho. I can't imagine this is gonna stick around in the theater long. Should do well in Streaming.

 I suspect we'll see a lot more from Ryan Destiny. She was fantastic. 

Just one question. Was it her biological dad &gt;!that molested her, or some random dude her mom brought home?!&lt; Either case, I thought it was a weird fact to mention. Especially if he was her Biological dad. Is he still alive?"
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,7,"The daddy tryna come around and take credit for Claressa success after being in prison most of her life had me dying. Anybody can make a baby, take a real man to be a father and the coach was her de facto father. Taught her all the things you need to know in and outside the ring."
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,8,"I appreciated the fact that, unlike most sports movies where they feel the need to use BIG SWEEPING MUSIC to make every scene dramatic, the director just trusted the writing and the acting to handle that. It was shockingly quiet for a sports biopic. Really well acted, solid writing, well directed."
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,9,I can‚Äôt stand seeing women who put men above their kids. How you gon kick your own daughter out for defending herself from your shitty boyfriends especially when one molested her
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,10,"That ending got me in tears man. Can‚Äôt believe being from Michigan I hadn‚Äôt even heard of her story before my mom told me about this movie. And I WATCHED both of those Olympics. Just shows you how true it was that female Olympic boxing just didn‚Äôt get the promo or hype that it deserved. 

I remember very intently watching both of those games because of the 2012 men‚Äôs basketball team going for a back to back after the redeem team of 08, and then 2016 for Brasil getting their first gold in football. Claressa being the first American boxer to ever get back to back golds is insane. The whole state and country are proud of her and she‚Äôs a reminder that it‚Äôs not about where you‚Äôre from, but where you‚Äôre going."
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,11,"4 comments on this thread... sheesh no one went to watch this. I thought this was a good movie, nothing special but still entertaining. Glad she continued her career and didn't give up!"
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,12,What song was played during the prom scene?
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,13,As someone from Detroit and Michigan in general I‚Äôm so proud of this movie being made and doing well. Giving Ressa the attention she deserve
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,14,"I‚Äôm shocked by the lack of comments on this post. My boyfriend really wanted to see this movie and we had two free tickets to the movies, so we went to see a matinee showing of it today. There were only maybe 6 people in the whole theater. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like it that much as sports movies aren‚Äôt usually my thing, but it was a compelling story told well with a fantastic leading actress.


Also, the soundtrack went hard and I haven‚Äôt been able to find out what that rap song was from the middle during her training montage. Anyone happen to know what it is?"
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,15,"Shields has been one of my favorite fighters for years and while I do think this movie's first portion kind of suffers around pacing I think that the essence of who Claressa Shields is and how she carries herself shines through in the latter half. She has always been direct and true to herself. Always talked the tlak because she could walk the walk and in moments where she's failed or struggled she always takes that loss but pushes forward again. 

Ryan Destiny really did an amazing job emulating Shields and I hope to see her in a lot more works going forward. 

I am wondering what led them to do the pawning of the gold medal scene instead of what really happened where Claressa almost threw the medal in a river before family stopped her. Still a super powerful moment showing how the win itself didn't mean as much as getting proper recognition for all the work put in to get there."
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,16,A good underdog movie.
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,17,"As with many secret movies, this was not a movie I was planning on seeing. I might have caught it on streaming, but definitely not in theaters. That said, after the shock wore off, I still stayed and watched this movie. To my surprise, I actually enjoyed this one. Despite the fact that biopics, especially sports biopics, are very formulaic.

What I liked about this is that this movie follows the formula, gets you to the Olympics, get you to the big win, and then the movie isn't over by a long shot. There is more to the story, and that is what intrigued me. That said, the pacing is all off on this. I don't mind that we pretty quickly get to the 2012 Olympics, BUT the story after those Olympics is what is really good (going into the plight of star female athletes post-Olympics), and unfortunately, what you want to see at the end is reduced to showing you a short true-life clip of the real person and then some photos and text. The movie probably needed to get to the 2012 Olympics even quicker and get to where the actual movie ends quicker, and then give us 10-20 minutes of the end stuff instead of reducing it all to photos and text.

Also, I tend to rail on musical and sports biopics, but I'm kind of a sucker for them, even if they are flawed. If you are also a sucker like me, you'll enjoy this.

This one is directed by Rachel Morrison, who is making her directorial debut after a career of being a DP on such films as ""Dope"" and ""Black Panther."" This is written by Hollywood vet Barry Jenkins. I think the above explains what I think, this movie is made well, BUT Morrison and Jenkins combine to spend too much time on certain aspects of the story, and not enough on the satisfying ending. This is shot well by DP Rina Yang. I suspect Morrison being a (former?) DP herself, knows how to find good ones.

The cast is good. Ryan Destiny gives a great performance as our hero, and I'm a huge fan of Brian Tyree Henry. I think he's great in everything he does, even if the film itself isn't great. Everyone else is good, no complaints on cast.

As I said above, I liked this one, but didn't love it because it cheats us out of the good stuff at the end. It's not one I can recommend to people in terms of going out of their way to see it, but this is produced by MGM-Amazon, so I'd expect in a few months (or less), it will be on Prime Video. It's a decent enough Prime watch for sure, if you like these kinds of films. This won't change your mind if you hate biopics though. 3 stars out of 5.

Edit: nice downvote for no reason. Ridiculous."

The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,19,Anyone know the name of the track featuring Mos Def that was played in the film?
The Fire Inside,1hlsi3n,20,A very decent sports biopic. The writing and acting just did its thing. Reminds me of old school directing. Its all about the story here and a fresh look too.
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,1,"The third act was so odd. The giraffe just coming over and being like oh shit it's Mufasa and it never being explained how they knew him is genuinely baffling. The entire thing felt like there was a five or ten minute chunk where we see the Lions fitting in and making friends, which would have made Mufasa's speech more impactful. Really wish they cut all the Timon and Pumbaa shit for more time with the actual story"
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,2,The Lion king scene of simba‚Äôs birth held such weight. It felt like this was a tradition for generations and it was well known . Come to find out it was a 1 off thing done on a rock formation created from a earthquake a couple years ago üòÇ
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,3,"This movie really got me sick of Timon and Pumbaa after a while. I get they need moments of levity but it really loses momentum jumping from the main story to have the ones listening to the story interject with dumbass commentary. That was my one beef with The Book of Life as well.

But like‚Ä¶I mostly enjoyed it. Compared to something like Alice Through The Looking Glass, this was a little more fun."
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,4,"Since Mufasa and Scar are adoptive brothers here, if they made a new Lion King 2 movie, they can make Kovu Scar's son like originally intented."
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,5,"Scar saved Mufasa like 4 times, and made up for his sin, to call him scar the rest of his life instead of his name was just cruel, forgiveness is also a value, I don‚Äôt like that being taught to children"
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,6,"Kiara **and** Kion? Interesting.

So we‚Äôll be getting a *Simba‚Äôs Pride* remake to round out the trilogy (with echoes of *The Lion Guard* to it)?"
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,7,"Some thoughts and critiques after having watched it last night: 

* Timon and Pumbaa could have been cut entirely. They added nothing to the story and interrupted a fairly compelling story. I mean, there's only so much fourth-wall breaking I can take. The 1994 film had one break-the-fourth-wall moment, but this universe's Timon shouldn't be addressing he's a puppet in the stage musical, or joking about legal issues with the song ""Hakuna Matata"" (a song, in-universe, that he and Pumbaa came up with). 

* It's a complete missed opportunity to not depict or reference Mufasa's father (either his adopted or biological) telling him about the Great Kings of the Past. 

* Somehow, I missed it or there was an issue in the editing, but Mufasa killing Kiros's son was a blink-and-miss moment. I know Mufasa fought one of the Outsider white lions, but it didn't linger enough on the body to clue in the character was dead. 

* Taka's motivation for turning evil is rather flimsy. I always felt Taka/Scar felt a sense of superiority, but was always outshined by his brother. We saw that portrayed here, but remember the line Scar told Mufasa that he had the ""lion's share"" in intelligence in the 1994 film. Well, I saw none of Scar's perceived intelligence in this prequel. 

* I never felt I needed Rafiki's staff or the formation of Pride Rock to be explained. 

* I did like the callbacks to the original film with the wildebeest stampede, the death of the father, and Scar latching his paws into Mufasa's. I especially loved the leitmotifs of ""Under the Stars"" and ""King of Pride Rock"" soundtrack pieces, though I felt a monarch ascending Pride Rock to claim the throne was a generational tradition rather than a one-off thing.

* Water acted as an interesting motif. It's used as a force of destruction and tragedy, as a symbol of identity when looking at your reflection, and romance when Mufasa and Sarabi were on the snowy mountains. 

* The CGI was as visually dazzling as the 2019 remake, and thankfully, they added character expressions to the animation. 

* I really liked the song ""Always Wanted a Brother"". The villain song ""Bye Bye"" was okay and forgettable."
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,8,"Few things the movie contradicts from the original, them being blood brothers and Mufasa always meant to be King

Scar - ‚ÄúWhy if it isn‚Äôt my big brother descending from Mount High to mingle with the commoners.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell as far as brains go I got the lions share but when it comes to brute strength‚Ä¶I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm at the shallow end of the gene pool.‚Äù 

Mufasa was rightful king (older) and they were blood."
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,9,"It would have been a 10/10 if when Kiara meet her new little brother she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always protect you , I‚Äôll be your Lion‚Ä¶..guard.‚Äù roll credits üòÇ"
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,10,"Movie felt like a bunch of check boxes that needed to be ticked off.
There was no room for any plot point to develop.
The movie would‚Äôve been better if they cut out the present time scenes and give those run time to the main story‚Ä¶"
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,11,"I watched it. It was....just ok. The last half of the movie especially was SO RUSHED it gave me whiplash.  
  
I felt like they didnt do the greatest job of turning Scar into the Scar we know, it was also very sudden. He goes from the wimpy kind hearted ""Prince"" to conniving son of a lion within 5 minutes of a scene.  
  
Mufasa is such a Mary-Sue or I guess Lion-Sue? Lion-Stu? Can literally do no wrong.  
  
""Kimba"" as I call him in my mind because thats what the lion king ripped off and its time for that white lion to get his revenge...  
  
  
Had such a horrible song....I dont understand how you can give your villain such a bad song lol. Esp considering how great ""Be Prepared"" is, in this they have the villain singing something like ""Bye bye"". Im mean and menacing ""bye bye"". I shall kill you and get my revenge ""bye bye"". All the songs were bad to mediocre at best.  
  
Its amazing how watered down these things are compared to what we got as children.  
  
We most definitely did not need Timon/Pumbaa interjecting throughout the movie. It was stupid."
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,12,"I was mostly interested in scar's origin story, and why he became a villain and turned on mufasa - I was kinda disappointed that it was all because mufasa got the girl scar liked for a couple days... like scar really had 1 awkward convo with the girl and then his brother got with her and then he tried to kill his brother?? was hoping to see that scar's hatred was more justified than that"
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,13,"The film finally addresses the question everyone got.

How did Rafiki got his staff? Surely it was so important it couldn't be missed here. We couldn't just live without knowing."

Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,17,All I know is that Barry got a bag and now he can go back to making incredible films/series
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,18,"Given how much they were talking about ""The Bloodline"" early on, I was disappointed that The Rock didn't show up during the climax as The Final Boss."
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,19,"Honestly as a spectacle it was fine, servicable visuals, okay music and the direction was nothing I'd complain about. 

The story was a hot mess though, the pacing was so weird and the fact that I sat through 2 hours of what was essentially a love triangle between 3 lions broke me. 

Taka's personality shift into Scar was so jarring I didnt even feel like the last 15 mins of the movie had the character that the first hour and a half had. Taka didnt even try to like put down his brother or lie or boast? he straight went to murder via a pack of lions that killed his family? he was set up as a coward how did he all of a sudden have the courage to go into a pride of murderous lions and play the manipulative victim villain playbook? It just didnt track at all. Honestly I feel like for the guy who the movie was named after the plot kind of happened to Mufasa instead of him making the plot happen. Dude didnt want to leave his parents, didnt want to leave his adoptive mother, didnt want the girl (initially) and he didnt want to be king.

like i get that maybe that is the point but it just felt so hard to root for him when he kept showing reluctance about every single plot point."
Mufasa: The Lion King,1hiae58,20,"I didn‚Äôt really grow up watching a lot of Disney movies, but the one I have seen most of all and love the most is definitely The Lion King. Still, it was no surprise to me after a string of ‚Äúlive action‚Äù remakes that just don‚Äôt hit the same that I didn‚Äôt care for the 2019 remake for so many reasons, paramount among them being the focus on realism when the power of animated films is clearly the ability to let the animals emote. I will try not to retread that [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/cew5fw/comment/eu6jdwa/?context=3&amp;st=k1bthl3h&amp;sh=e1f64962) too much here, but I will say if anyone can get this emotion to land a bit it is Barry Jenkins. And to that effect, this movie doesn‚Äôt do a terrible job. Unfortunately the music is extremely forgettable and the script is pretty boilerplate prequel stuff. 

To Barry‚Äôs credit, I really appreciated that he went actor first, singer second for this. Nothing against the previous cast, but we all know that priority was flipped. Aaron Pierre has a great voice and gives an honestly great performance in this. Mads Mikkelsen rocks, Taka (Scar) is played by Kelvin Harrison Jr. who was incredible in Waves. Jenkins hasn‚Äôt exactly been silent about how much he prefers to film people rather than something like this, but he‚Äôs still getting really solid performances out of this cast and the parts of this that hit emotionally for me, specifically the third act, were thanks to that. 

However, I spent a lot of the rest of the movie rolling my eyes and searching for any song to enter my showtunes rotation. The 1:1 relation of every song to a song from the original Lion King is extremely noticeable, from Taka singing a song about how he‚Äôs soon to be king to a song where our ragtag team of misfits sings about how great life is when you‚Äôve got your friends to a villain song that takes so much from Be Prepared but is actually called Bye Bye and fucking sucks. Maybe it‚Äôs stupid of me to want something original from a prequel of a remake of a reimagining of Hamlet, but Disney is just so clearly losing their confidence to make original things. They didn‚Äôt even feel confident enough to make new comic relief characters so we have to keep going back to Timon and Pumba making really out of place 4th-wall-breaking jokes. 

Speaking of boilerplate prequel necessities, I get that it‚Äôs a no-brainer to give the people what they want in a movie like this, but it‚Äôs really every single moment and plot device. Rafiki finding his walking stick, Scar getting his scar and changing his name to Scar, the claws in paws saving movie they use twice, even Mufasa‚Äôs relationship to water needs a backstory since Simba used to see him in reflecting water. I can take a good amount of this stuff, but Pride Rock being formed in the finale really bothered me. Can‚Äôt some things just exist previous to or between these movies? This movie has different voice actors for the younger characters (Rafiki, specifically, has two different voice actors in this very movie) and yet it feels like this takes us right up to Simba‚Äôs birth, or that literally nothing happens in the years between. 

It‚Äôs a 5/10 for me. I was very much taken by the vistas, the swooping camera (could have done without the go-pro strapped shots), and the scenery. For a minute I even kind of understood why Disney is so obsessed with this undeniably impressive technology, but really it just made me want to go home and watch either the original Lion King or Planet Earth, I just may never understand why they had to be blended together.

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,1jr0qw5,1,"I hadn‚Äôt thought about this movie in years and yet it has lived rent-free in my mind since I was 13. This may have been the movie to teach me about tropes, really, the way that it so effectively uses all the familiar conspiracy thriller beats a la ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù got branded into my young mind. I was actually quite surprised to see when I looked it up on Letterboxd that people don‚Äôt like this movie. I rewatched it this week and, while obviously not perfect, I still got quite a nostalgic kick out of it. 

Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker, a truly early 2000s cast, not to mention Leslie Bibb who is currently having her White Lotus moment. It‚Äôs actually insane to think this was 25 years ago, she still looks fantastic. I also love that this movie is mostly about Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen beefing. You‚Äôve got Coach and the Manhunter himself pulling these strings and they just give me such great ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù vibes. 

As far as similar conspiracy thrillers go, maybe this isn‚Äôt the most unique one. But it is so specific to a time and place. I really loved the moment when the plethora of models walk into the Skulls party and Higher by Creed starts playing, and they basically play the song in full with lyrics. It‚Äôs no mystery why 13-year-old me latched onto this. Plus you‚Äôve got some Papa Roach, some Collective Soul, some Fatboy Slim. This just really takes me back to a simpler time. 

There‚Äôs definitely a fantasy element that probably played really well to me back then too. The fantasy of one day being accepted into the elites, all your money problems and unsure future plans suddenly secured. I loved the touch that when he‚Äôs taking money out of the ATM it says, ‚Äú$20,019.43‚Äù or something, implying that he wouldn‚Äôt even have been able to take out twenty dollars in the first place. Not just the fantasy of security, but also the idea that a 19-year-old could pull one over on a 200 year old secret society that has endless resources and surveillance. 

Overall, even knowing this is just a carbon copy of so many movies before it and since, this still hits for me. The soundtrack, the cast, the tropes, they just bring me right back. It‚Äôs a 7/10 for me. A movie above any other!"

Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,1,"It was just a good time at the movies, I'm glad there are movies like this still coming out. I don't expect it to be a smash hit commercially or critically but you get plenty of laughs, a bit of romance, some good rocket launch scenes. Heart-warming stuff"
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,2,"I saw it at the Screen Unseen.¬† I thought it was a great story that could have been a much better movie than it was.¬† I really enjoyed the last 30 minutes or so,¬† although overall it was a little bland.¬† Scarlett was great.¬† I like Channing Tatum but he didn't really seem to fit in to the 60s, there's something overly modern about him and I'm not sure why.¬†¬†"
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,3,"Look, admittedly, I love NASA, I love the space program, and I love watching beautiful people do fun and incredible things on a giant screen, so I am this movie‚Äôs target audience. I got emotional at the use of real Apollo 11 footage. I laughed a lot.

It‚Äôs a nice movie. I had fun."
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,4,Way too long but honestly charming and funny. I really appreciated the deep respect and admiration this film had for the people who helped us get to the moon. Those portions felt very real and genuine and it moved me every time.
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,5,"I feel like the movie could have been marketed better to be about how publicity helped fund the moon landing rather than focusing on the fake broadcast. The fake broadcast doesn‚Äôt even become a part of the movie until the third act of the film.

Overall, I really liked the characters and enjoyed the premise. My main complaint is it felt a little too long. Pacing was a bit slow.

7/10"
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,6,"Honestly? Pretty enjoyable movie, not grounbreaking by any means but managed to get a good laugh out of me once or twice.

So far haven't watch anything that I didn't enjoy from Apple."
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,7,‚ÄúI‚Äôm a member of the DGA‚Äù is one of the hardest laughs I‚Äôve had in a theater in a long time
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,8,"I saw this at the AMC Screen unseen 1-1/2 weeks ago. Just gonna paste my comment from that sub:

Did anyone else notice how barren the sound design was in the movie? It was uncanny. No matter where they were, there was almost never any sort of background noise. In a crowded room, you don‚Äôt hear chatter; when people are walking, you don‚Äôt hear footsteps; when they‚Äôre eating dinner you don‚Äôt hear the silverware on the dishes; in the control room, you don‚Äôt hear any clicking of buttons or dials. The only exception was when it was a sound that the characters noticed, and when they were at the beach the ocean was surprisingly audible. It just made this soulless movie feel all the more lifeless."
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,9,"Was funny, for me it was actually the minor roles that stole the show more than the pair of leads, like Jim Rash, Ray Romano and Woody Harrelson."
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,10,"Saw this last weekend during an early release.

I really enjoyed it. I thought it was funny, the chemistry between the characters was solid, and the production value honestly looked really good. Yeah it drags at times, but I was entertained the whole time. Even during the more ridiculous story elements, I felt it was going for the light ‚Äúhistorical fantasy‚Äù thing.

Reminded me a lot of ‚ÄúFord v. Ferrari‚Äù. It‚Äôs not as good, but it‚Äôs got that punchy, funny, character-driven style. Solid movie"
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,11,"My genuine biggest complaint is Tatum's costume. I get he's got star power and we need reminding he's the lead, but giving him muscle fit turtlenecks in a room of dorks with poorly fitting shirts was...odd. 

I wasn't expecting them to make him comically nerdy with horn rimmed glasses or anything, but even a white shirt would have made it stand out less. 

That said, it was a very charming movie. If the above is my biggest complaint, then it says a lot about the film. Not earth shattering, but a fun night of cinema."
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,12,"Too long, I liked it, but what was weird is I think the movie would have been 100% better and even more coherent if Woody Harrelson and the entire fake moon landing story were just cut from the movie. It really didn't add anything to the overall movie beyond forced conflict.

The rest of the movie was very good."
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,13,"Nepotism is usually bad, but Colin Jost‚Äôs scene was maybe the funniest of the movie and made funnier by the fact it was Colin Jost."
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,14,I saw it as a Monday Mystery Movie and really enjoyed it. Scarlett Johansson was great.
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,15,"I actually really enjoyed this one. It's nothing ""new"". I'd liken it to a summer bop song. You know where it's going, but you sit back and enjoy the fun, comforting ride. All of the big stars in this crush it. Oozing charisma and carrying some scenes. I got a few laughs and the predictable ending.

My main complaints are around the misleading trailers about faking the landing. This only factors into the final third of the movie. I also think the run time could have trimmed a bit to get it closer to the 2 hour mark."
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,16,"Liked it alright. I think it might‚Äôve been better if it were a bit more streamlined and focused, and therefore allowed to breathe more in scenes, but it might‚Äôve also fallen apart in attempting that. None of the ideas are opposing, but it takes a vaguely indirect approach to its destination.

The movie ‚Äî after it‚Äôs all said and done ‚Äîseems to want to be about a romance between the person in charge of the moon landing and the one who‚Äôs having to fake it. However, it can‚Äôt jump right into that without the audience having an immediate disdain for the faker, so instead we get this, where the first half of the movie is at times just spinning its wheels. You could do a movie that‚Äôs just that first half, too, but doing both is a bit tricky. The climax of this film is so completely disconnected from the conflicts we see in the first act; ScarJo is brought in to help NASA‚Äôs image problem and garner funding, but besides a quick aside to talk to the senator, those issues may as well have not existed at all based on the last 30/45 minutes.

‚ÄúWe need you to fake the moon landing‚Äù should be the inciting incident at the end of the first act, but instead it comes after we‚Äôre already halfway through a slightly different movie.

Most of the stuff here is enjoyable, but it can feel like a plot that‚Äôs mid-Animorphs transition from one concept to the next"
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,17,"Saw this last Monday and half the audience got ready to leave when Woody started singing, myself included. Found it more comforting than expected"
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,18,"This movie could have been so much better than it was. It made no sense for ScarJo‚Äôs character to be a con artist the way she was operating‚Äîa marketing exec straight up lying from one client to the next. We‚Äôve already seen a marketing exec lying about their identity in the 60‚Äôs with Mad Men, which pulled it off a million times better. Channing Tatum is also not convincing as a 1960‚Äôs leading man, and the dialogue and jokes didn‚Äôt fit the era either, though I could be swayed that that‚Äôs a stylistic choice. 

Beyond that, the characters and plot were all over the place. It would have been incredible to have the movie build up to the moon landing and really let it breathe, let the audience revel in the feat and see the real footage, but instead the movie was totally distracted by the fake landing B plot."
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,19,Certainly see where the budget went. Looked great.
Fly Me to the Moon,1e15yu0,20,"I really could not get into this film because Tatum‚Äôs character was so off putting. It did not feel believable that he was both so intelligent and capable to conduct his job, but also so hopelessly stupid emotionally. I could not keep up with his roller coaster of outbursts, and the constant acceptance of his behaviour by ScarJo‚Äôs character. Visually a lot of the film was very charming, but I was taken out of the story constantly. When ScarJo‚Äôs character explained her entire background near the end(which was traumatic) all Tatum‚Äôs character did was ask if she was going to ¬´¬†lie again¬†¬ª to fix the ¬´¬†problem¬†¬ª. It was so obnoxious and poorly written.

EDIT: also felt like weird American propaganda the entire time."

Love Lies Bleeding,1jvy4l5,1,I've been waiting for this for a long time. It feels so uninspired. It's thematically nowhere near the likes of Rango nor is it entertaining enough like Moana. The first act suffers the greatest while the rest of the movie does gradually get a little better. Often the movie feels like a direct to TV sequel that had some noteworthy ideas but didn't use enough talent to execute them - the exception being Po's childhood. That scene was a 10/10
Love Lies Bleeding,1jvy4l5,2,"Ok, let's just talk about this inner peace analysis.

Why does Po want to find inner peace? First, Shifu tells him that all the great masters have found inner peace, so he lays it before Po as just an abstract goal. And Po at first thinks of this goal as just any other thing, naively approaching it with a ""let's do this thing"" attitude before the bandits attack the village. So at this point, it's just a box to check.

Then they find out about the bandits, lord Shen, etc. During this time two things are shown that are disruptions to Po's inner peace: his past trauma during the flashback from seeing Shen's symbol, and the subsequent revelation that he's adopted. He's also perplexed 'how kung fu can stop something that stops kung fu', and Shifu tells him with inner peace anything is possible. So at this point, inner peace becomes a way to complete this mission.

Tangentially, Po also says that if can't stop this threat as the Dragon Warrior, who really is he? His dad says his son, but at this point Po is not in a position to find peace in that idea.

On the boat we see him struggle with the concept of inner peace, again not really understanding it. He tells Tigress he wishes he could not feel anything on account of them being warriors. Read: he'd again just wants to push his emotions/trauma down cause he's a 'warrior' and those things are getting in his way.

He attempts to do things this way, but when Po has a flashback and it's revealed that Shen was the cause of his parents death/past trauma, he's unable to complete the mission and Shen gets away. This leads to direct conflict with the team: now it is apparent that Po's unresolved issues are actively getting in the way of the mission.

He goes without the team to fight Shen anyways, driven not just by the mission but now by wanting to quell his turmoil by getting answers from Shen. Again, because he hasn't dealt with his issues, he's easily distracted by Shen's innuendos, and almost dies.

The Soothsayer helps him see the need to confront his past and process his emotions, which he does, and finds inner peace by accepting that even though he has been through trauma, he is still able to choose who he is. This gives him clarity to be able to successfully face even someone who has induced as much trauma on him as Shen, and also being able to be fulfilled and happy being Ping's son.

In the movie Po's journey with inner peace is a little deeper than you let on I think. He starts off with naive idealism towards it the idea, tries to just push it down, tries to force it, and eventually has to come to understand what it is and how to achieve it. In the movie the idea of inner peace is not necessarily directly spiritual, but it is about confronting and processing trauma and emotions in a healthy way, along with self actualization."

Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,1,"My biggest takeaway reading through this is that you have a joy of movies that really comes through in your comments. It really comes off that you find something interesting to latch onto in everything you see with only a few exceptions for the ones at the bottom of the list. And even then, it feels like everything is given a chance.

I really enjoyed this list. I hope 2023 brings you many more exciting trips to the cinema."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,2,Wait a second... which pinocchio? At a 6/10 I'm unsure if u dislike  the del Toro one or liked the Disney one haha.
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,3,"I‚Äôm surprised you thought **Mrs Harris Goes To Paris** only deserves 5/10.

Did you not watch **Everything Everywhere All At Once,** or did I miss it?

Edit: found it - 8/10"
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,4,"Really interesting thoughts, but the rating the stood out to me the most was Blonde - 8/10"
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,5,"This guy is singlehandedly keeping cinema alive. Kudos to you. I can't afford to see more than a handful of films a year so I have to be very picky, but I would love to see every one released if I could afford it."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,6,Wow. Can I ask why you only gave Flee a 4/10?
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,7,"I thought Bullet Train was a really fun movie. Not amazing or anything, but I had a lot of fun watching it."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,8,"I just wanted to let you know that I look forward to this post every year. It will be a 104 movie year for me, catching I Wanna Dance With Somebody today."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,9,2/10 for Hatching? That one really threw me.
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,10,"Do you use Letterboxd? If not, it would be perfect for this kind of thing."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,11,"Man, I saw 150 movies this year and thought that was a lot, LOL.

More power to you, and thanks for the reviews."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,12,Doctor Strange 2 and Everything Everywhere receiving the same score is a travesty
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,13,"&gt;Morbius 4/10

I think you mean 14/10, movie of the decade."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,14,"When I saw Worst Person in the World in theaters, so many uncomfortable guys with sobbing dates when the credits rolled. I got teary eyed myself though"
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,15,"Someone who's seen Ramona! I still have to catch it but your high praise will finally push me to watch it. I wasn't enamoured by the trailer. 

I agree that Official Competition is Penelope Cruz's best performance to date. 

I read the book that Simple Passion is based on. It's only about 80 pages long so I wondered how they would make a film out of it. A shame that's it nowhere near as good as the book. Happening is also based on an auto fiction by the same author, Annie Ernaux."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,16,"I think I saw like three movies in theaters this year, and the only one I remember was Morbius. I saw it with some buddies and it was probably the best movie experience I've had in a long, long time. The movie wasn't good in any way but we had so much fun because we knew it was bad

I haven't watched it again, but one of the guys I saw it with did and he said it was super boring and had nothing redeemable about it

So I guess that's my movie experience for this year"
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,17,Sonic 2 is 10/10 and you're not gonna change my mind. üò§
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,18,"Well that's impressive! [I also released my list of favorite of the year](https://www.takeaside.ca/post/matt-s-20-favorite-films-of-2022), but it's always fun to see someone's take and you clearly saw A LOT! How cool was it after the pandemic to be able to go to the movies all the time? Love it."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,19,"I'm a cinephile, but I'll tip my hat to a true master.  Overall, I felt your rankings were spot on, and your love for film shines through your brief synopsis reviews.   I'm not surprised that you ranked Babylon near the top of your list, when I watched it I had mixed feelings about the film, but several days later I can't stop thinking about it.   For people who watch a lot of films, Babylon was the apex of grand Hollywood film making, a tribute to cinema and the art form, but casual film goers will most likely get put off by the films vulgarity.

I'm going to check out some of the films on this list.  Overall I felt this was a crummy year for film, but now I might see some movies that will change my mind."
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,zzvg5y,20,"The real hero of 2022: you

Thanks for sharing!"
Twisters,1jr0qw5,1,"I hadn‚Äôt thought about this movie in years and yet it has lived rent-free in my mind since I was 13. This may have been the movie to teach me about tropes, really, the way that it so effectively uses all the familiar conspiracy thriller beats a la ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù got branded into my young mind. I was actually quite surprised to see when I looked it up on Letterboxd that people don‚Äôt like this movie. I rewatched it this week and, while obviously not perfect, I still got quite a nostalgic kick out of it. 

Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker, a truly early 2000s cast, not to mention Leslie Bibb who is currently having her White Lotus moment. It‚Äôs actually insane to think this was 25 years ago, she still looks fantastic. I also love that this movie is mostly about Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen beefing. You‚Äôve got Coach and the Manhunter himself pulling these strings and they just give me such great ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù vibes. 

As far as similar conspiracy thrillers go, maybe this isn‚Äôt the most unique one. But it is so specific to a time and place. I really loved the moment when the plethora of models walk into the Skulls party and Higher by Creed starts playing, and they basically play the song in full with lyrics. It‚Äôs no mystery why 13-year-old me latched onto this. Plus you‚Äôve got some Papa Roach, some Collective Soul, some Fatboy Slim. This just really takes me back to a simpler time. 

There‚Äôs definitely a fantasy element that probably played really well to me back then too. The fantasy of one day being accepted into the elites, all your money problems and unsure future plans suddenly secured. I loved the touch that when he‚Äôs taking money out of the ATM it says, ‚Äú$20,019.43‚Äù or something, implying that he wouldn‚Äôt even have been able to take out twenty dollars in the first place. Not just the fantasy of security, but also the idea that a 19-year-old could pull one over on a 200 year old secret society that has endless resources and surveillance. 

Overall, even knowing this is just a carbon copy of so many movies before it and since, this still hits for me. The soundtrack, the cast, the tropes, they just bring me right back. It‚Äôs a 7/10 for me. A movie above any other!"
Twisters,1jr0qw5,2,If y'all dont like this movie you can meet me in Liar's Hell
Twisters,1jr0qw5,3,"It's wild. I was randomly thinking about this film the other day. I only ever saw it once and like another redditors said its sort of been in the place of simultaneously something that I hardly think about but also which lives rent free in my mind.

I was thinking that they don't really make films like this anymore."
Twisters,1jr0qw5,4,This movie is such a male power fantasy.
Twisters,1jr0qw5,5,This movie lived on Starz when I was a kid. I watched it a million times just because it was the best thing on at midnight. I always wanted it to be better than it actually was though.
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,1,"I‚Äôm so happy I could return the favor by having you at the premiere! It would not have felt right without you after all of your absolutely LEGENDARY posts on the first movie. 

Hey guys this is Sev. Writer/producer on these movies. I‚Äôm the guy in the suit in the middle of the picture. 

(To some of the folks on here saying this is a planned ad‚Ä¶ please just look at u/plw37 post history. You can see he and I engaging on Easter eggs years ago.)

Btw fun fact about chatting with him during the after party of the premiere movie (pictured above): U/plw37 told me he wanted to only focus on the story of the movie during his first watch and save looking for Easter eggs for the next time he‚Äôd see it. But still somehow he was able to list a TON of hidden secret details - including the obscure place I hid his username. üëè"
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,2,Congrats OP! That‚Äôs so cool. I saw a test screening for this movie. Absolutely loved it. It‚Äôs so much fun.
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,3,This is legit one of the coolest posts I've seen on this sub. Congrats!
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,4,"That‚Äôs very cool. I only got around to watching Searching a couple weeks ago, but it instantly became one of my all time favourites. Very excited to see Missing."
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,5,Luckily your username isn't mine.
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,6,That is so damned cool! Congrats!
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,7,"That‚Äôs awesome man, congrats!"
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,8,"That's so cool! Loved Searching, will definitely be seeing Missing too. It's nice they're so active on Reddit too."
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,9,"Super cool, but I wish you had a name like ButtMuncher6969"
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,10,"Well, your posts on ""Missing"" are gotta be full effing legendary :)  


Congrats, mate!"
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,11,This is awesome. Loved the first movie and thought that having the whole movie on some sort of screen was done really well
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,12,So you was like Wayne and Garth in Wayne world with backstage passes for couple of days?
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,13,"Well, congratulations! Sometimes the nerds and geeks win the brass ring!"
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,14,That's really cool. It's great to see such a positive and constructive connection between a creator and a fan. Congrats!
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,15,Who would have thought being a Reddit nerd could pay off
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,16,Who thought it was a good idea to put ads for Missing on Uber??? Huge turnoff.
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,17,"That's legit, my hats off to you"
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,18,How exciting for you. Congratulations.
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,19,"This is really awesome, my friend. Congratulations!"
A Place Called Silence,10e605h,20,If Missing gets a DVD or Blu-ray release your story would make a cool behind the scenes featurette
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,1,"I would throw my entire life away for Nell Tiger Free in that club outfit

This was kinda awesome. It has a scare that reminds of one from Pulse (you know the one) which is basically the highest compliment I can give a horror movie."
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,2,"Oh this was sick and twisted. I‚Äôll definitely keep an eye out for this director in the future. When so many prequels and sequels are made these days which virtually every studio is hungry for. 

It‚Äôs so rare for these to actually have a sense of style and vision like this does. There are a lot of times when they could have gone for the easy shot or sequence and they didn‚Äôt. 

In the opening scene with Charles dance has all that glass falling on him I think with another maybe lesser movie and director we see him die a brutal death immediately. There isn‚Äôt a a pause where you think he might be ok. It‚Äôs a small thing but there a lot of moments like that. 

On that note the nun who was for sure sexually abusing Clarita burning herself was a little too on the nose in terms of callbacks although I give it props for not being a literal identical situation but still 

While I‚Äôm happy that clarita and Margret got out and lived a few years in peace (there is for sure gonna be a sequel to this right. Like an interquel of their perspective during the first omen. I‚Äôd watch it under this creative team. 

Also someone walked out which was surprising."
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,3,The part after the car crash was the scariest part. Convulsions and looked similar to dare I say‚Ä¶ a jackal
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,4,The ending caught me off guard when Father started talking about the Damien Initiative.
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,5,"My favorite little moment is in the beginning when Margaret leans against the wall and her feet slip out from under her a bit. Really small moment but since it's the movie's only moment of levity, I appreciated it."
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,6,Bill Nighy the Cardinal Guy.
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,7,In the sequel Margaret and Sydney Sweeney are fighting and losing then suddenly they hear ‚Äúon-a your left-a‚Äù and they turn around and it‚Äôs fat Russell Crowe on his Vespa
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,8,[deleted]
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,9,"I love when twin movies are super specific. 

A movie where an American nun moves to Italy to work in a care home and then has to deal with an unnatural pregnancy."
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,10,"The Possession (1981) nod was really unexpected and pretty cool. 8/10 a good horror movie that relies on atmosphere instead of excessive jump scares or lazy suspense, probably one of the best looking ones in a while and experiencing this with a mildly full audience reminded me of stuff like Smile and Barbarian."
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,11,"Her moving the picture closer to the file, flipping it, then placing it on top reminded me of the detective in South Park doing high in analytics on a hand print. Then he rotates his hand and has an ""ah ha"" moment when it matches lmao



Favorite scenes were her floating down the dark hallway, the slow reveal of the burnt nun in the corner, and the C-section (no score till the camera pan was almost over. ""I'm in pain""). 


Some people gasped at the closeup of the hands going into the incision and I was like ""you just saw a hand coming out of a vagina earlier, and this is the one?"""
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,12,"That was bone chilling to watch. Perhaps it‚Äôs part of my lapsed Christian background but religious horror can always scare the shit out of me.

You saw the red herring coming a mile away but it was still effectively scary. A part of what make this even more scary is the realistic situations. Margaret‚Äôs night out with Silva and Paulo is played like date rape. When Margaret is seeking to remove the antichrist it‚Äôs feel like it‚Äôs played out to trying to find a back alley abortion clinic. The fact that a faction of the Church willingly would birth the AntiChrist to control and bring people back to church is both novel and horrific.

The possession and supernatural scenes are used sparingly but were effective in how scary they were.

The ending was oddly bittersweet and if they‚Äôre going to do more with this series, rebooted continuity it makes me wonder what roles Margaret, her sister, and daughter have to play"
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,13,"I don‚Äôt even have a vagina , but that claw birth hurt my vagina."
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,14,Apparently it's showing in 35mm in select theaters. I absolutely would see this in 35mm if it were available near me.
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,15,"I went into this with basically no expectations and it knocked my socks off. This is a rare example of a legacy sequel (or prequel in this case) that both adds to the original franchise and also stands on its own as a pretty good movie. I also appreciate how far out they were willing to go, especially by the standards of a studio franchise movie. The scene where the devil hand comes out of that lady's hooha is super fucked up on its own but it's kinda mind blowing that it happened in a Disney movie. 

I thought the direction was really strong, especially considering I had never heard of Arkasha Stevenson before. Shout-out to my guy Ralph Ineson who was born to play the exposition dump guy in a movie like this. His voice is just buttery smooth which makes it really easy to forgive the fact that he was playing a nothing character that only exists to explain what's going on. Also shout out to Charles Dance who seems like he only spent 15 minutes on set but still helped sell that opening scene really nicely."
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,16,"In retrospect a few hours later, the only thing that really took me out of the movie was the part where Margaret walked the torso like 6 feet away from the truck without realizing it had no legs. That scene played like comedy to me. The rest of the movie was top notch."
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,17,"I'm gonna be thinking of this movie for a while. I just loved the creepy atmosphere they kept through the entire movie. Evil beings hiding in the high positions of a holy religion and we just get to see the twisted things they've been doing for almost two hours. Only at the end do we get to see a figment of something happening that could potentially be the downfall of this insidious plan and that only leaves me wanting more. 

Here's my rating: I'm buying this on physical media"
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,18,"I‚Äôm genuinely surprised a major studio greenlit a film this dark and fucked up. I thought this was awesome, might end up being the most underrated film of 2024. Nell Tiger Free put in an incredible performance. 

I liked how this didn‚Äôt have too many conventional scares, it was a real slow build up. The last 20 minutes are unbelievable. I love being this surprised by a film."
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,19,I didnt understand tho how did paolo knew about Margaret from the club and why tf did she lick him
The First Omen,1bw6bk7,20,Please go see and support this.  We need more big studio horror like this.

It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,1,I wasn‚Äôt a fan of Ryle casting at first but he definitely had them crazy eyes.
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,2,I needed way more Atlas
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,3,"As a victim at a really young age of domestic violence , one of the most eery scenes for me to watch was when he brought the magazine and was egging her along to read it to him. The tone, the cadence, it is EXACTLY the Tone of a crazy jealous lover. My arm hair was standing up on end. When he started reading it back from memory I felt like I had lived that scene. No matter what the cast drama
Is, Justin Baldoni stood out to me . And I was one who wasn‚Äôt initially supportive of his casting."
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,4,"Blake was horrible miscast. Did she only compete against Sydney Sweeney? 

Her younger actor/version acted circles around her."
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,5,"My wife brought me along for what I thought was going to be a romantic comedy, and oh how wrong I was lol. 

My eyebrows were raised immediately when he kicked that chair. Her ""I'm an unreliable narrator"" comment was a good setup for the future scenes. 

Honestly I would've liked it more if the script and editing were tighter. It felt 30 minutes too long."
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,6,"That line from Jenny Slate that went something like ‚Äúas his sister I hope you forgive, but as your best friend, if you take him back, I‚Äôll never speak to you again‚Äù was such a great scene. Idc if timeline wise it hadn‚Äôt been that long, it makes you feel the importance of having a friend that cares for you and doesn‚Äôt look past the problematic behavior of someone in their own family. I enjoyed the movie for the friendship aspect and the flashback sequences"
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,7,"I just saw it. And I‚Äôm really torn as to what I think about it. I liked the acting, mostly liked the message, but some of the stuff just took me out of it. Between the totally not-Boston, the boy version and man version of atlas looking the same age and NOTHING alike, along with many dumb decisions the main character makes."
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,8,Who the hell was in charge of wardrobe for this movie?
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,9,"Honestly the part that hit me the hardest was the subtle line from the mother about not leaving because it was easier to stay. So many women get stuck in abusive relationships because leaving is just too hard or scary. It's made pretty obvious her husband was wealthy and in a position of power. Despite living in her own personal hell, it felt safer than the unknown. I found this one scene deeper than the rest of the movie combined."
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,10,"As someone who has a lot of trauma growing up, this movie really resonated with me and I think Blake Lively always smiling was perfect because she‚Äôs always constantly trying to hide her problems behind her smile and bring joy into other peoples lives even if hers isn‚Äôt. I think it was very good, even thought it did feel rushed and some things didn‚Äôt necessarily connect as well as in the book. I think it overall was very good."
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,11,As someone who read the book I was relieved to see the dear ellen letters were left out
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,12,"It's actually well acted and directed.

But what abuser admits he's wrong? That was easy. She tells him ""what would you tell your daughter"" and he's like ""oh yeah I can I'm the bad guy"".

I feel like an abuser would be offended if you tell him hey you're hitting me."
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,13,"Judging by the comments it feels like it‚Äôs better to have not read the book before seeing the movie. I went to it with my wife knowing nothing about it, she had read the book. She thought the movie was just okay. I thought it was one of the better ‚Äúmovies I probably wouldn‚Äôt have gone to if I wasn‚Äôt married‚Äù I‚Äôve been to. 

The only thing I‚Äôll say is I laughed out loud when they revealed older Atlas. Cause they like lingered on him like: ‚Äúoh yeah recognize him?‚Äù And he looked nothing like the younger version"
It Ends with Us,1eno8g8,14,"I'm not sure if the film was bad or Blake lively was just really really bad in it. She literally smiles all the way through, even when there's nothing to smile about.

IF,1gj7quc,1,"I wasn't a fan of the ending either; she didn't have any officers with her so she wasn't there to arrest him. The last conversation they had on the bench said everything that needed to be said. 

I didn't particularly like the flashbacks to the night of the incident when no new information came to light. 

It would have been a nice twist if the boyfriend actually committed the crime and our protagonist was going to bat for him out of misplaced guilt. The prosecutions case was **weak as fuck** too, every piece of evidence was circumstantial. 

10/11 of the Jurors said guilty, depending on how you think J.K would have voted and the lone hold out was Hoult. He could have ended it there, imagine the ending where he sways people to vote not guilty and then it's found out later that the dude actually did it. That would be a gut punch."
IF,1gj7quc,2,Absolutely no way that Scythe doesn‚Äôt win an appeal based on all that extremely flimsy evidence.
IF,1gj7quc,3,"Just got out of this film. It‚Äôs got a lot of flaws and in dire need of proper script supervision. However, the ending isn‚Äôt so terrible. 

There is an article that talks about how Eastwood filmed that scene in a number of ways. Faith on her own, cops at her side, and with cop cars in the distance. He then deliberately decided to go with #1 for the purpose of ambiguity. All good that you don‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶but it wasn‚Äôt unfinished or lazy. It was the storyteller‚Äôs decision. 

https://ew.com/nicholas-hoult-toni-collette-explain-juror-2-ending-8738598"
IF,1gj7quc,4,I don‚Äôt think it was ambiguous at all. It‚Äôs pretty much that she‚Äôs going after him. If anything it‚Äôs the opposite of what Justin does which is live with what he did both killing the girl and wrongfully imprisoning her boyfriend for his own selfish gain. Faith is going to basically sacrifice her career for justice whereas Justin had no interest in ever getting justice for the girl despite his guilt.
IF,1gj7quc,5,"Hey OP, I agree with you. I went to see it last night and have been looking for somewhere to vent my frustrations about the film. Spoilers ahead for people who might want to watch this.

To start, I found the characters to be rather one dimensional and cliche; the angry people of colour, the ditzy older woman, the stoner kid, etc. The contrivance of having an ex cop and a medical student as part of the jury to guide them to this alternative theory made me audibly groan.

Also, what the hell was Kiefer Sutherland‚Äôs character even really there for?? He had screen time of basically two minutes to effectively tell the protagonist that he would be in trouble if he came forward. Why was this needed?? He even gave that talk to Hoult at the beginning about the burden of secrets while at the AA meeting only to later basically do a 180 and essentially say ‚Äúoh yeah, you‚Äôd be totally fucked if you came out with what happened‚Äù.

That leads me onto the wife who I thought was going to be the moral Centre of the film, given the spiel that Hoult gave about her making him want to be a better person. Only for her to be immediately ok with her husband having killed someone and lying to the authorities about it. No moral dilemma, no real discussion about what they should do, just ‚Äúoh, you did it? Let‚Äôs never talk about it again.‚Äù

The scene where Hoult is on the bridge being confronted by the stereotypical angry black guy juror: It seemed for a moment that he was onto Hoult and there was going to be some tension about what he knows, what he would do with that information etc. was there? Absolutely fucking not. Just ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never going to change my view on the defendant‚Äù and we never see him again.

The next scene undercuts the whole tension that had been building about exploring this alternate theory by immediately pronouncing the defendant guilty. How did it go from deadlock to unanimous guilty?? Especially when a few of the jurors were completely sold on the hit and run theory!

Then you had that absolutely cringe moment of realization from Toni Collette where she sees Hoult in the back of the courtroom and then has an epiphany that he was the guilty party. Cue her then googling ‚Äúx‚Äôs wife‚Äù and being IMMEDIATELY shown pictures of the couple together. This came out of nowhere, there were far better opportunities to have this epiphany moment - like when she visits his wife to talk about the car - but no, it was shoehorned in to the end as an apparent afterthought.

The confrontation between Hoult and Collette outside the court was also bizarre. Hoult seemed to be suggesting he is a good man and his family doesn‚Äôt deserve to be destroyed, then he finishes by saying ‚Äúif you come after me you‚Äôll be screwed politically‚Äù. Like, pick a fucking lane! 

The ending was an abysmal end to a frustrating movie. The (second) showdown where neither of them say anything and the cut to credits seemed lazy to me. For a film that was so full of contrivance and exposition dumps, it didn‚Äôt earn the ambiguous ending. By the way, I have nothing against ambiguity in the ending of a film, providing the story was strong enough to earn it and make you think meaningfully about it. This was not one of those films.

If this is Clint‚Äôs last film then what a terrible end to an otherwise solid directing career."
IF,1gj7quc,6,"With respect - fuck you Mr Eastwood

Lamest ending I have ever seen. And those 5 times flashbacks without anything added to it, what was that


Hoult's dialogue at the end about justice and truth - very bad &amp; villainous"

""&gt;!Jury returns not guilty verdict. Hoult returns to the scene of the crime one last time and uncovers deer bones hidden under brush several feet from where the body was. Now thinking he may have actually hit a deer and that the boyfriend was actually guilty!&lt;"""
IF,1gj7quc,9,"Imo a better ending would have been. The defendant is found guilty and the prosecutor figures out the truth. Juror #2 is arrested...But jk Simmons was still on the case and we find out it was actually someone else that hit her and juror 2 did in fact hit a deer.¬†


As for the actual ending. Juror #2 is highly unlikely to be found guilty nor would a case go forward. There is zero evidence against him other than he got his car fixed. The og eyewitness is worthless since he already testified he saw the boyfriend stop that night and juror 2 never admitted guilt. She would basically throw her career away and he would be impossible to convict. Imagine trying to tell the story to a new jury with no physical evidence other than a fantastical story based on a wild accusation.¬†


I liked the ending because the movie is about our system of justice. What is justice in the first place?¬† It would have hit harder had they really painted the boyfriend as a really bad guy. I think she throws her career away and juror 2 either gets off or the case is tossed. But the fact that we have come here to even voice our opinion or discuss the moral aspect of the film means it worked as intended and that's what a good story does... it makes you wonder and want to talk about what you just saw.¬†"
IF,1gj7quc,10,Unsatisfying that‚Äôs really the word when I think of this movie¬†
IF,1gj7quc,11,"Terrible ending and in reality a terrible movie.  First off take Hoult's character out of it and there wasn't anywhere near enough evidence to actually convict.  Looking at the information the jury was presented and there was literally nothing that was actual evidence that the boyfriend did it.  There was evidence he \*could\* have done it but that was all.  That is absolutely more than reasonable doubt.  The jury discussions felt like a bad version of 12 angry men where they forgot to include any actual evidence.

Second the ending, she wasn't there to arrest him as she's a DA the police would have to be with her to arrest.  So possibly she is there to tell him she is going after him, that's the only plausible thing but why?  The DA always gathers evidence and builds a case first.  It is just a flat out lazy, shitty ending.

Third, there is even less evidence that Hoult did it than the boyfriend.  The best she can possibly do is find some people from the bar, over a year before, who put him at the bar that night.  That's it.  

Really a bad film made worse by a terrible ending."

IF,1gj7quc,14,"nah, the ending was great."
IF,1gj7quc,15,"This movie was so bad. I read a ton of glowing reviews before committing to spending ten bucks to rent it. I‚Äôd say the following is a spoiler, but since it‚Äôs introduced in literally the first scene, I won‚Äôt bother labeling it as such: the juror who is on the jury for a murder case where he realizes shortly into jury selection that the murder victim was actually killed by HIS-OWN-SELF on a night when he mistakenly thought he had hit a deer.  I‚Äôm not even going to waste any more of my time tonight than necessary giving this the thorough lashing it deserves, but the plot is ridiculous, the acting and dialogue are foolish, it‚Äôs so utterly loaded with gaping holes, and every time I thought it couldn‚Äôt get more idiotic, I was proven wrong. I do not for the life of me understand how this movie got so many excellent reviews. If I can save your ten bucks, then at least it will have been worthwhile."
IF,1gj7quc,16,"&gt; Note: I would have put this in the official discussion thread for Juror No. 2, but I actually can't find one, perhaps because the movie just came out.

The movie is only in 50 theaters, so unless it expands more, it likely won't get an Official Discussion Thread here although I hope I'm wrong because I really liked it and have a lot to say.

I think the ending was great, and falls perfectly within the thought-provoking themes of what true justice is and how our biases may shape what should or shouldn't be justice."
IF,1gj7quc,17,"Agreed 100 percent. Also, jk simmons character was great and it just seemed so odd his character just leaves like that. It almost felt like there was more intended for him, but they couldn't quite figure it out?"

Only for a juror to later say ‚ÄúI have GOT to get home to my kids!‚Äù As if they their kids aren‚Äôt in school during the day or like she hasn‚Äôt seen them in months. I could give a million examples of this. Then there‚Äôs the ridiculous acting and the entire movie being cast with nepo babies. Lea Thompson‚Äôs daughter is the wife, Clint Eastwood‚Äôs daughter is the victim. Kevin Bacon‚Äôs daughter is a juror (who is literally the worst actor in the entire thing, literally deciding her judgement of the guy by saying ‚Äúhe was a jerk either way, so SCREW HIM!‚Äù Etc etc etc. This movie is ABSURD."
Kung Fu Panda 4,1jvy4l5,1,I've been waiting for this for a long time. It feels so uninspired. It's thematically nowhere near the likes of Rango nor is it entertaining enough like Moana. The first act suffers the greatest while the rest of the movie does gradually get a little better. Often the movie feels like a direct to TV sequel that had some noteworthy ideas but didn't use enough talent to execute them - the exception being Po's childhood. That scene was a 10/10
Kung Fu Panda 4,1jvy4l5,2,"Ok, let's just talk about this inner peace analysis.

Why does Po want to find inner peace? First, Shifu tells him that all the great masters have found inner peace, so he lays it before Po as just an abstract goal. And Po at first thinks of this goal as just any other thing, naively approaching it with a ""let's do this thing"" attitude before the bandits attack the village. So at this point, it's just a box to check.

Then they find out about the bandits, lord Shen, etc. During this time two things are shown that are disruptions to Po's inner peace: his past trauma during the flashback from seeing Shen's symbol, and the subsequent revelation that he's adopted. He's also perplexed 'how kung fu can stop something that stops kung fu', and Shifu tells him with inner peace anything is possible. So at this point, inner peace becomes a way to complete this mission.

Tangentially, Po also says that if can't stop this threat as the Dragon Warrior, who really is he? His dad says his son, but at this point Po is not in a position to find peace in that idea.

On the boat we see him struggle with the concept of inner peace, again not really understanding it. He tells Tigress he wishes he could not feel anything on account of them being warriors. Read: he'd again just wants to push his emotions/trauma down cause he's a 'warrior' and those things are getting in his way.

He attempts to do things this way, but when Po has a flashback and it's revealed that Shen was the cause of his parents death/past trauma, he's unable to complete the mission and Shen gets away. This leads to direct conflict with the team: now it is apparent that Po's unresolved issues are actively getting in the way of the mission.

He goes without the team to fight Shen anyways, driven not just by the mission but now by wanting to quell his turmoil by getting answers from Shen. Again, because he hasn't dealt with his issues, he's easily distracted by Shen's innuendos, and almost dies.

The Soothsayer helps him see the need to confront his past and process his emotions, which he does, and finds inner peace by accepting that even though he has been through trauma, he is still able to choose who he is. This gives him clarity to be able to successfully face even someone who has induced as much trauma on him as Shen, and also being able to be fulfilled and happy being Ping's son.

In the movie Po's journey with inner peace is a little deeper than you let on I think. He starts off with naive idealism towards it the idea, tries to just push it down, tries to force it, and eventually has to come to understand what it is and how to achieve it. In the movie the idea of inner peace is not necessarily directly spiritual, but it is about confronting and processing trauma and emotions in a healthy way, along with self actualization."

Red One,1jvyaym,1,"Probably because it would have shown a lack of leadership in dealing with a very real problem of a marine who was not performing well and ""writing letters to everybody but Santa Claus.""

Jessup was up for promotion to general.  An incident such as the above being ignored to the point that it led to the death of marine in his company would have been a black mark against him.  Better to fake the transfer order, etc.  After all Jessup had the arrogance to believe that he would not get caught."
Red One,1jvyaym,2,"I always took Jessep‚Äôs actions as a way for him to do what he feels is ‚Äúright‚Äù, especially as commander that lives by a code that he knows is in conflict with the rest of the world that ‚Äúhe stands on a wall‚Äù to protect‚Ä¶with great contempt.

So, he orders the code red because he feels that‚Äôs the right thing to do, but then orders the transfer to cover up the code red, because he knows it‚Äôs against the rules of ‚Äúthe bureaucrats‚Äù. But the thought of outright lying about the order isn‚Äôt an option for him, he‚Äôs too proud as a marine to do that, never mind doing so would fundamentally undermined his own order, if only to himself.

This is why him being asked directly about it in court is such a big deal: would he be so prideful that he owns the order or so cowardly to deny it? It was the defining moment of his character, and even after the reveal he maintains his righteousness."
Red One,1jvyaym,3,"On paper it looks better for him.  He was up for promotion and didn‚Äôt want any hint of impropriety. 

He had a Marine who was substandard and broke the chain of command.  The best thing to do would be to transfer him of the base.  That‚Äôs what Markinson wanted to do. 

Jessep disagreed and DID order the code red and thought that was the better way to handle it.  

When it went south he cut them loose and to cover that he made it look like he did what Markinson suggested in the first place but was too late.  

It would have worked too if it wasn‚Äôt for those meddling kids."
Red One,1jvyaym,4,"Markinson, before he kills himself, is a witness against Jessep. Hence it's not just their word against his. Hence the cover-up. Once Markinson is dead however, yes, Jessup can just lie his way out of it. This why putting him on the stand is so risky."
Red One,1jvyaym,5,"Because then we wouldn‚Äôt have gotten this amazing exchange:

Did you order the code red!?

You‚Äôre goddamn right I did!"

Red One,1jvyaym,7,jessep was a narcissist who thought he was untouchable the transfer farce was to prove that santiago was worthless and his death was an accident not a crime but his ego led him to overcomplicate everything when he could say I didn't say anything and that was it in the end his pride was his downfall like any good shakespearean villain
Red One,1jvyaym,8,"There was way more of a paper trail for the order given the Marines chain of command. Markinson, Kendrick, Dawson, et al all knew about the order. A fake transfer order was a way to insulate himself and it would have worked if he hadn't melted down on the stand."
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,1,I think the most impressive thing about this movie is that the trailers actually kept the president plot line a secret.  10/10
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,2,"I liked how the Beekeeper org said ""ok we'll send someone to kill Jason Statham."" And after he kills the girl, they just give up. ""Lol ur on ur own fuck this."""
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,3,"You can tell that they really wanted to make you hate the villain. Not only did someone have to lose their retirement, they had to lose millions in a charity benefiting children and they had to commit suicide too. It also couldn't be some losers working out of a normal call center. They had to do a wolf of wall street and use the money to fund an electoral campaign.

I think I found my guilty pleasure movie and it's going to be added to my physical collection."
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,4,"Top 3 moments:

- 'Chekhov's gun' attempt where Statham very purposefully takes a jar of honey from his dead landlady's house. We're left wondering what the purpose of it is until he just beans it at some woman's head during an action scene and then sets her on fire

- Statham using a staplegun to interrogate some guy who he says is 'directly responsible' for the death of his landlady. Note that this is the first scene this guy has appeared in, he's working in a completely different call centre to the guy that scammed his landlady, and we *just* saw him kill the guy who was *actually* directly responsible about ten minutes ago when he strapped him to a truck and drove him off a bridge

- Jeremy Irons getting asked 'What do you prefer - the money or the power?' to open a scene like that's completely normal dinner conversation for rich people"
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,5,"My favorite things: 1. The nonstop constant bee talk and bee analogies. Hilarious and never ending. 2. The deputy director of the FBI flies to Boston. Sits down with the agents. Asks, ‚ÄúWhy is he on this rampage?‚Äù ‚ÄúTo protect the hive.‚Äù Thats it, that‚Äôs the only explanation he gets and he‚Äôs totally okay with it. Fucking hilarious."
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,6,The dummy being driven off the bridge cracked me up
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,7,"After watching Statham strangle people and slice off fingers for the past hour, I started laughing in confusion when he started slapping the guy with a stapler."
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,8,"Ending was all like ""That's all folks!"""
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,9,"""Nice shirt. Did you get that off a corpse, you dog fucker?""

That might not be one of the twenty most absurd lines in this movie and I absolutely love it. This is a dumbass action movie that knows exactly how dumb it is and it absolutely fucking rips. Jason Statham is great as a dude that basically never talks except for a handful of vaguely coherent bee analogies. Jeremy Irons is great as Jeremy Irons. Josh Hutcherson is great as Hunter Biden. This shit rocks. Inject a sequel directly into my veins"
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,10,"I knew it would be cheesy based on the premise and January release date but it's hilariously fun.

The Beekeeper,194kp4v,12,"
I think it was great, but I‚Äôm not sure just how self-aware they were as to *why* it‚Äôs great when they were making it. Yes, the action‚Äôs generally pretty good; that last fight with the South African dude was legitimately well done. But it‚Äôs the unfazed approach to doing or saying the goofiest shit that makes it worth a watch.

They stuff in so much bee-related bullshit, and it‚Äôs funny every time. I kept expecting them to drop it and they never do. Statham being the most serious motherfucker as he tells every single person he comes in contact with how society is like a beehive‚Ä¶ magnificent. And not just that. Josh Hutcherson‚Äôs first appearance in the film has him on a skateboard for a while, in a ‚Äòthis guy thinks he‚Äôs too cool for school‚Äô way, like it‚Äôs the early 2000s or something. So much of the bad guys‚Äô dialogue felt right out of a Neil Breen film (the line currently coming to mind is one woman‚Äôs only line asking Jeremy Irons whether he preferred the money or the power). Speaking of, was Jeremy Irons supposed to be American, or was the CIA run by a Brit for some time? 

I laughed so goddamn much, and I think I was laughing with the filmmakers and not at them, but I‚Äôve seen Suicide Squad, so I can‚Äôt be sure.

It‚Äôs like someone took the premise and general plot structure from a script from the 80s and kinda tweaked it to be a more modern action film. If everyone knew but was playing this entire film straight-faced, then it‚Äôs incredible, and I want a million more of these. If I‚Äôm wrong, though (and looking at the writer‚Äôs [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934483/), I very well might be), and people were genuinely trying to make a ‚ÄòJohn Wick meets a hyper-fixation about bumblebees‚Äô, then damn.

Also, RIP to that innocent dude at the gas station who had his car taken by Statham. He‚Äôs for sure dead."
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,13,I appreciated how the bad guy at the end had a bright orange outfit and Statham had a grey suit on so it was very easy to follow the action.
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,14,"As soon as I saw Josh Hutchinson playing the shithead millennial bad guy, I knew we were in for a fun time. Fun movie all around that knows what it is and revels in it."
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,15,"My favorite part was when Statham looks directly at the camera and explains why stealing from old people is bad. Up until then I was on the fence about it, but after he explained that it's wrong I was convinced."
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,16,The main FBI girl was awful
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,17,"it doesnt get much mention here but the south african merc that comes in near the end is a top shelf meme in itself.  its always some south african or european(usually Danish) guy with no scruples that becomes the final boss.  

""to be or not to be, that is the question""

""i choose--- the Bee"" ahahahaha

and I'd like to believe this movie is more cerebral than it seems on the surface.  theres a scene with the FBI agents talking in the field office and in the background is some jobbers working on a leaky ceiling, and this goes on the whole scene.  i dont know if this is supposed to be some symbolism of how decrepit the american justice system is, but its too prominent to ignore

and speaking of the FBI agents- theres some debate on whether this whole movie is a parody, well i can tell you the FBI, at least, definitely are.  the two have the strangest *The Room*-esque dialog between them

""you like fires? because your mom's house is burning""

""i lost my virginity in that barn""

every interaction with the FBI deputy director was awkward, presumably because he knows of the Beekeepers, but he didnt even bother trying"
The Beekeeper,194kp4v,18,"My favorite scene in this ridiculous movie is when the swat team is discussing the different ways to enter the building and Statham suddenly pops his head up in the middle of them ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no back entrances, im going in this way‚Äù and beats the shit out of all them"

What a perfect father he is!

This is a complete and utter embarrassment of a film and I truly hope that everyone involved in it from top to bottom is deeply ashamed of themselves. Except they won't be, they'll be clinking champagne glasses and pouring one out to Amy Winehouse, having just shat on her entire life and career through their Mitch-tinted glasses. They didn't even use her own voice and music."
Back to Black,1ctu2pt,2,"Her being told Blake had a kid with his new wife then almost immediately cutting to black and ""Amy Winehouse was found dead"" was so mind-blowingly tone deaf and offensive that I burst out laughing in the cinema.  
  
Fuck everything about this movie except Marisa Abela's performance."
Back to Black,1ctu2pt,3,"I was actually quite impressed that a film about one of our generations most soulful voices could be so bland and empty. 

A large part of the movie takes place during Amy's teen/early adult years, which would've been late 90s/early 2000s, but it just felt like... not that time period? It looked and felt like this was a generic ""rise to stardom"" flick from the 2010s, even from the beginning of the movie. Idk just a weird vibe as a whole. 

Script was painful at times and as good as Marisa Abela did, I still thought it was overacted in some scenes. Just an absolute mess of a movie (not to mention the inaccuracies).

2/5 and it's only for the music"
Back to Black,1ctu2pt,4,"You can't make this shit up can you? Sam Taylor-Johnson ‚ÄúI have no talent but look! I‚Äôm going to make an unnecessary movie about Amy Winehouse to show I‚Äôm actually talented and not some hack of a filmmaker and a groomer. So it‚Äôs all good!‚Äù. Mitch Winehouse, involved in a boring, yet, generic piece made for naive audiences, to demonstrate that he isn‚Äôt some greedy sack of garbage and society needs to know he is innocent. Studio learns all the wrong reasons from Bohemian Rhapsody to make a lifeless, dull,¬†and honestly, disrespectful biopic. And be just Hollywood style. After all, we are not just exploiting someone‚Äôs legacy, we‚Äôre changing lives and showing the good parts? I guess that‚Äôs the purpose of this movie right? No.

I feel bad for all the actors. Marisa Abela, Jack O'Connell, Eddie Marsan and Lesley Manville  are good actors who deserve so much better. ‚ÄúAmy (2015)"" is a much better emotional story.

1/10"
Back to Black,1ctu2pt,5,"I don‚Äôt really have much to contribute as I think many of the comments here already do more than an adequate job at describing why this movie fell so incredibly short. 

With that said, there are TWO aspects of this film that I did find to be well done:

1-Marisa Abela gave an incredible performance despite having next to nothing to work with. This movie would be utterly unwatchable if not for her. I hope to see her in the future starring in films with better scripts. 

And 2- the soundtrack, outside of Amy‚Äôs music is fantastic. So many good choices from Lauryn Hill to Minnie Riperton. I‚Äôm a sucker for a musical montage and those were some of the only genuinely enjoyable moments of the film for me (Amy galavanting around listening to ‚ÄúDoo Wop (That Thing)‚Äù &amp; her running to meet Blake, kissing him when ‚ÄúFlowers‚Äù reaches its crescendo) surprisingly strong points in an otherwise flatlined film. Kudos to whoever was behind those choices. 

P.S.- On a semi related side note, I had totally forgotten that Mark Ronson contributed to production on ‚ÄúBack to Black‚Äù until they referenced him in the film. It served to remind me of how bloody amazing that man is, and how over the years he has had his fingerprints all over, so many incredible albums. Man is a genius, full stop."

Back to Black,1ctu2pt,7,"I thought it was pretty good, knowing nothing about Amy Winehouse.  Reading the comments here is changing my mind about it.  I‚Äôll watch ‚ÄúAmy‚Äù and try to forget this."
Back to Black,1ctu2pt,8,"Ugh I wasn‚Äôt gonna see this, but a friend wanted to and now I feel really icky. This was so milquetoast and poorly done from just about every angle that you look at it. Amy deserved so much better than Mitch being the hero of her story. Sam Taylor-Johnson, you‚Äôd better hope there‚Äôs a merciful god out there that‚Äôs willing to forgive you, because I sure as fuck won‚Äôt."
Back to Black,1ctu2pt,9,"Ya know, I didn't know the gal or anything, but I feel like Amy would have hated this movie. Amy famously lived every song she ever wrote, she was obsessed with the truth, and compared to the well known 2015 documentary this movie tells a bit of a different story but doesn't have the receipts. 

To me, the line ""I ain't got the time/and if my daddy think I'm fine"" is one of Amy's more heartbreaking lines. The documentary paints a picture if an insecure woman who needed support to stay healthy and was failed on that front by the men in her life she put the most trust into. Her father having the final word on whether or not she should go to rehab and deciding she doesn't need it is a major part of her story. In this movie when she sings that line live at her Grammy performance and her dad lovingly laughs in the audience I wanted to puke. In the documentary he is not present, by secondhand admission she even says she's a promiscuous drunk because he left her mother and was absent, but he's nothing but present and supportive and has a scene where he literally falls to his knees crying upon finding out that she married a drug addict. 

Amy's story is so tragic it was hard to watch this version where it's all rewritten to focus on the conflicted men in her life. Framing her death as a reaction to anything Blake did feels so gross considering it was so many issues having to do with her rejection of fame, bulimia, being exploited by her father, being forced to tour, etc. All of this is represented at some point but it's so focused on Blake who irl was just kind of a dirty dirtbag she felt a cosmic connection to. 

Abela is solid in this, hard to sell an accent like this in a drama but she's good. The scenes that totally rely on her work. I hate how many times she bashfully draws all attention to herself by singing in a room full of people, but her studio and stage performance recreations are impressive. They clearly didn't want to have to depict other celebs, choosing not to show Mos or Tony Bennett beyond archival footage. 

There was also one really great scene where she's performing in another country and she's like jumping off the stage and getting close to the audience and it's like shea compulsively doing all this crowd work and every stumble and every decision she makes in the moment requires interference from the stage hands to keep her safe. Very indicative of how much she needed support, the doc is clear about this too how she just needed someone she loved to tell her how to be. 

4/10 for me. I don't think true life movies need to be exact with the facts, but it just wasn't a super compelling movie as well as being largely false.

Back to Black,1ctu2pt,14,Why is Blake played by a middle aged man???? He was super young looking when they first met..
Back to Black,1ctu2pt,15,"ohhhh i can‚Äôt wait to rip this to shreds‚Ä¶

all of the comments about the plot and general dialogue as well as the talent of Abela is spot on. not only is this film 90% fiction, it paints Amy as a weak obsessive woman who is entirely defined by her relationships with men and that she is completely responsible for the treatment that she received from them. my jaw was on the FLOOR watching them paint her father and terrible boyfriend as martyrs. i am disgusted and i think that Amy and her talent and personality was totally disrespected. it‚Äôs like they did no research before they made this film nor talked to anyone important in Amy‚Äôs life while making it. even if they did, the narrative is spun in a blatantly prejudice way against women, substance users (specifically the blaming them), and people who live with mental illnesses. awful. additionally, it totally skips over how much pressure she received to push herself well beyond her limits to please everyone around her. she is so much more than this awful film and i wouldn‚Äôt recommend suffering through it."
Back to Black,1ctu2pt,16,"Reminded me of that John Belushi biopic ""Wired"". An anti-drug film that's way too on-the-nose and blatant in it's message. Ironically both movies have pretty good lead actors though. With that said, the one thing this movie does right is show what real pieces of shit paparazzi are. Other than that though, skip it and watch the documentary made about her instead."
Back to Black,1ctu2pt,17,"This movie was a mess. If you're looking for an honest portrayal of her, watch ""Amy"". The documentary shows you everything you need to know about the strange and beautiful creature who was Amy Winehouse. It irritated me that this actor even tried to replicate a once-in-a-generation voice like hers. (Not her fault though. It's not a teachable skill) 
Couldn't find anything redeemable about this film"
Back to Black,1ctu2pt,18,"I don‚Äôt know Amy‚Äôs story, outside of her songs. I found the movie‚Äôs story and lead performance to be top tier. I laughed and cried. It did a good job of portraying emotions in many scenes. The stage performances were very emotional, it felt like I was watching the woman who wrote and lived the songs. It‚Äôs a drag if her dad was indeed a monster where this movie portrayed him as being there for her, but Abela is an amazing actress; her name on a poster will definitely sell me a ticket in the future."

MaXXXine,1jr0qw5,1,"I hadn‚Äôt thought about this movie in years and yet it has lived rent-free in my mind since I was 13. This may have been the movie to teach me about tropes, really, the way that it so effectively uses all the familiar conspiracy thriller beats a la ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù got branded into my young mind. I was actually quite surprised to see when I looked it up on Letterboxd that people don‚Äôt like this movie. I rewatched it this week and, while obviously not perfect, I still got quite a nostalgic kick out of it. 

Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker, a truly early 2000s cast, not to mention Leslie Bibb who is currently having her White Lotus moment. It‚Äôs actually insane to think this was 25 years ago, she still looks fantastic. I also love that this movie is mostly about Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen beefing. You‚Äôve got Coach and the Manhunter himself pulling these strings and they just give me such great ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù vibes. 

As far as similar conspiracy thrillers go, maybe this isn‚Äôt the most unique one. But it is so specific to a time and place. I really loved the moment when the plethora of models walk into the Skulls party and Higher by Creed starts playing, and they basically play the song in full with lyrics. It‚Äôs no mystery why 13-year-old me latched onto this. Plus you‚Äôve got some Papa Roach, some Collective Soul, some Fatboy Slim. This just really takes me back to a simpler time. 

There‚Äôs definitely a fantasy element that probably played really well to me back then too. The fantasy of one day being accepted into the elites, all your money problems and unsure future plans suddenly secured. I loved the touch that when he‚Äôs taking money out of the ATM it says, ‚Äú$20,019.43‚Äù or something, implying that he wouldn‚Äôt even have been able to take out twenty dollars in the first place. Not just the fantasy of security, but also the idea that a 19-year-old could pull one over on a 200 year old secret society that has endless resources and surveillance. 

Overall, even knowing this is just a carbon copy of so many movies before it and since, this still hits for me. The soundtrack, the cast, the tropes, they just bring me right back. It‚Äôs a 7/10 for me. A movie above any other!"

The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,1hd2vab,3,"Not bad or terrible like many hoped, but it could have been better. Animation a bit stiff, sometimes feels a little too slow paced. I feel they didn't take advantage of the strengths of animation, in making things more epic beyond what's realistic, like the numbers in the battles felt too small scale. I did like how Helm Hammerhand was basically Hoarah Loux, man was a beast.

All in all a decent watch, but I feel like the gem needed a bit more polishing both in terms of animation and writing to really shine."

‚ÄúJon Snow and Ned Stark‚Äù

That thought came into mind whenever there were action scenes. Liked the use of the shield. The shield was MVP. This felt like a larger than life legend that is told by Eowyn. It‚Äôs a nice touch to have Miranda Otto back as narrator for this.

I liked the animation overall. It looked great.  The action was solid for the most part. Hera was an engaging protagonist and Brian Cox absolutely ate as Helm Hammerhand. This felt like a Greek tragedy or a Shakespeare play animated. I did feel like the film dragged at times and the villain was meh to me. But I do want to see more animated works on Tolkien later. I would love to see the Tale of Beren and Luthien or The Doom of Turin Tarambar done in animation. Animation can help push some of the outlandish into view better than live action."

Definitely more palatable if you're a fan of anime. I liked some of the repeated themes from the trilogy, but honestly did feel just like a repeat of Helm's Deep.

My biggest gripe was how serious it was, since there's always been levity in LOTR. Also the dubbing. Also it dragged a bit. Hmm, maybe it really is just for LOTR fans..."
The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,1hd2vab,19,Absolutely in love with Hera‚Äôs design especially at the end with the bridal dress. She looked so ethereal

LMAO, I laughed so hard when I heard that. In a movie with a strong LOTR feel and a weak anime feel, that line sounds so out of place. It sounds like something out of a Shoujo series.

Overall, a very good movie, I really like it."
Here,1ip0usd,1,"This is the type of performances we need right now. No yelling, no over-emoting, no hand gestures, just subtlety."
Here,1ip0usd,2,"Let me start by saying that Fernanda Torres‚Äô acting should become a benchmark for internalized performances. What she‚Äôs doing here is bonkers from a technical perspective and grounded in the sort of skill and intelligence that can only come with a lifetime of dedication to the craft. By far, this is the best single piece of acting I‚Äôve seen all year. She is hands down the most deserving contender for this year‚Äôs Best Actress Oscar, and it will be a travesty if she doesn‚Äôt win, (I have a feeling she will, though. The impact of her delivery is just too overwhelming to be passed on.)

Movie-wise, I knew it was a real story going in and I knew the outcome, but nothing could prepare me for the naturalistic approach that keeps the story grounded and relatable even when the script swiftly covers some mandatory biopic tropes. That includes a couple of time jumps that some viewers are complaining about, yet worked wonderfully to me.

Here's the thing: there are two epilogues (so to speak), the first taking place in 1996 and the other in 2014. Yet, the way I see it, this is not a ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù situation. Those sequences are ultimately essential to further the movie‚Äôs main theme, which is the preservation of memory through documentation - either as a proof that we were once here, either as an undeniable record of a dark past that politicians everywhere often attempt to rewrite for their own purposes.

In 1996, we see only the two youngest children, who were more shielded than the oldest siblings from what was going on with their family back in the 70s, and the ‚Äòclosure‚Äô comes with the printout of their father‚Äôs death certificate. Like the collection of super 8 home movies and pictures and newspaper articles, this piece of paper has a greater meaning; it ties their intimate stories to capital-H History.

In 2014, when the government finally admitted its role in their father‚Äôs death, the mother‚Äôs memory had basically deteriorated after years dealing with Alzheimer‚Äôs. The final shot is important to show us the expanded family and the legacy and values and faith in life that was passed on through its generations ‚Äì but a nice touch here is how the daughters attempt and fail to recreate their mother‚Äôs famous souffl√©.

It's not that the matriarch failed to document - as in to write down - the recipe per se: the way I see it, this is a testament to little things that belong to us, and us only. We‚Äôll take them with us when we‚Äôre gone. Like when someone says ‚Äúno one could ever make a souffl√© as good as mom's‚Äù, and you have your own memories of the taste and texture that your own children won‚Äôt get to experience. This becomes a bittersweet memory that you‚Äôll cherish even more because, even though it‚Äôs bound to be lost in time, it‚Äôs unique to our families.

Throughout the film, director Walter Salles gives a lot of emphasis to certain objects that are reflective of an era and a way of life ‚Äì the vynil records, the Coke bottles used as tanner -, and also to objects that are filled with emotional significance ‚Äì the mother‚Äôs coat, the daughter‚Äôs baby tooth, etc. The importance of any given object is up to the personal memories we project in them. They become mementos of our existence and triggers for remembering. Subtly, they all add up to the gut punch that the movie delivers with a featherweight touch. For such a sad story, I'm Still Here is surprisingly uplifting in a way.

Do NOT miss out on this one!"
Here,1ip0usd,3,"Going into this I didn't realize it was based on a true story. Learning that after seeing what a big warm family they had at the beginning and seeing how the loss of a beloved father sent them reeling really affected me. 

Great film about a period I wasn't familiar with. I'm sure this hits twice as hard in Brazil."

Here,1ip0usd,6,"In Brazil, this film struck a nerve with audiences in a visceral way I‚Äôd never seen before. I went to the first screening in my city and the room was packed. As the credits began rolling, loud applause erupted and between the claps you could hear so many sniffles and people wiping their eyes. I even saw a couple older viewers, who likely had lived through the era portrayed in the film, raising their fists and calling out, ‚ÄúDitadura nunca mais‚Äù [‚ÄúNever again to dictatorship‚Äù]. It was a moment that went beyond the screen, and from what I‚Äôve seen on social media, this same reaction played out in theaters all over the country. You had to be there to truly grasp it."
Here,1ip0usd,7,"Towards the end of the movie, when Eunice gets a phonecall in 1996, someone behind us whispered ‚Äúit‚Äôs him!

Here,1ip0usd,8,"I am somehow surprised that international audiences were unaware that this is a true story. Marcelo Rubens Paiva is a very famous author and columnist in Brazil, and his family‚Äôs story is well known. 

If anyone‚Äôs interested, Marcelo‚Äôs autobiographical books (including ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Still Here‚Äù) are excellent reads, but are slightly tonally different from this film. Marcelo‚Äôs life is filled with tragedy. Besides his father‚Äôs death, he had a drunken accident (dove head first into a pond in his early twenties) that left him paraplegic, and yet the books are fairly humorous and entertaining. I‚Äôm not sure how well the comedic nature of his writing will translate into other languages, though."

This is one of the most well casted families I‚Äôve seen put to film. This is a family of 7, all in different age ranges, all written as unique and complex characters with their own personalities and reactions and then cast adult and kid versions of 5 characters. And each actor was cast perfectly, from the way they look like an actual family, to their ability to portray that through expressions and body language. When we aged up you basically could tell which daughter was which by looking at them. The entire cast was top notch."

Here,1ip0usd,11,"I managed to catch I‚Äôm Still Here and The Seed of the Sacred Fig on the same weekend, and that was quite an emotional double punch.

I‚Äôve written this a couple times before, but what gets me about this movie is the *waiting*. With movies, especially tentpole movies or crowd-pleasing movies, you‚Äôre expecting a big climactic, triumphant moment. But this movie is about all the time that goes by when you‚Äôre just stuck, waiting. Waiting for news, waiting for legal filings, waiting for change. You hear these stories about ‚Äújustice finally served,‚Äù but it‚Äôs hard to really parse what it‚Äôs like waiting until‚Äî*if*‚Äîyou get answers, justice, closure. What all those years in between really mean. It‚Äôs a triumph that she got answers for her husband‚Äôs death and a horrific tragedy all in one."
Here,1ip0usd,12,"I am not from Brazil but somehow the story felt familiar and universal, and the feeling when they got her father's death certificate was so bittersweet."
Here,1ip0usd,13,"This movie had a really slow effect on me. I didn't actually know this was a true story going in and the movie keeps you in the dark as to what is going on for a lot of the middle in order to emulate the feelings the family had going through this. So there were bits that felt aimless, but when the ending comes it all made sense. How wide of a scope this is, how deeply hurt but still enduring this family was, and how strong Eunice had to become when her husband was taken.

The first noticeable thing about this movie is it really takes its time to show you how much this family loves each other. The first, like, 30 minutes are all great vibes, a big family, a great dad. There are undertones that the dad is involved with politics and hushed conversations, but because it does the work early on his absence is really felt once he goes. Obviously the tone of the movie changes from then on, but as this movie goes you realize the long term torture of not even knowing what happened to your father/husband and the fear of knowing that even asking could land you in prison must have been so brutal.

Fernanda Torres is amazing, of course. The way she starts off as a normal housewife and shows up when she's called upon to become to sole breadwinner of her five children and fight corruption however she can without going to prison and leaving her children alone. She walks an incredible tight rope. Early on there's a telling scene where they get a phone call in bed and the husband says it's work, I'll take it downstairs please hang up. And I thought she was going to listen in, but she just does exactly what he asks without question. She just had no interest in whatever he was up to, and she trusted him. But when he's gone, she has to decide how much of a revolutionary she's going to be, how much she needs to fight and how much she needs to accept what is and focus on her children. It's a quite performance that doesn't quite hit until the time jump when you see that she truly got this family to thrive on her own.

Overall just a great depiction of how changes in regime can affect entire generations. What really got to me is that this was one family in one country under one dictatorship, yet the loss and the void left in it is felt so much. And this happens to thousands of families across hundreds of dictatorships and countries all through time. It's one story that is representative of so many more and that is when this movie really got to me. That and when she saw her husband on television during her final years, and the way she mustered a single smile for the final family photo. It's an 8/10 for me. It's a bit long and if you don't know what it's doing the pacing can seem odd, but if you're not missing the forest for the trees this is a massive gut punch.

Here,1ip0usd,14,Classic
Here,1ip0usd,15,Saw this during the limited release based on Torres's GG win and I was floored. My personal favorite performance and film of the year.
Here,1ip0usd,16,"This was an easy 10/10 for me, and I don't give 10s on these ratings lightly. I was just absolutely floored by this film. They did such a tremendous job of building up the family, then terrifying you when the authorities show up and take away the father, then just emotionally devastate you by the end of the movie...

For real, I was thinking about how the scary moments at the end of the first act, when military police show up at the house, were probably far scarier than any scene in most horror films I've watched. 

I was ready to see Demi Moore take home an oscar for best actress, but after seeing this movie, I will fucking riot if Fernanda Torres doesn't win the oscar. The quiet dignity and strength of her character was beyond impressive. (I'll also riot if this loses anything to Emilia Perez...UGH)

I think what fascinates me the most about this movie is how, in my opinion, it wasn't particularly cinematic, artistic, breaking any innovative ground in filmmaking. It just sought to tell a real life story as best as it could, and it knocked it out of the park. When you see a movie about something you may know next to nothing about, and you come out of that movie feeling like you want to know more about it, that's the hallmark of a great movie or at least a movie that has done its job. I don't know that I was even aware that Brazil was ruled by a murderous dictatorship in the 70s, but after seeing this movie, I'm glad to see someone make a movie about it, especially one as powerful and meaningful as this one."
Here,1ip0usd,17,"I've never seen this happen in a movie before, but at the end of my screening an old man in the front row stood up and boo'd audibly all the way through the epilogue text on screen. Then he sat back down and stayed through ALL the credits. I wanted to go up to him and ask afterwards why he was booing, but I thought he might just be a crazy person so I decided not to lol."
Here,1ip0usd,18,"The acting in this movie, my GOD. For a while there i genuinely forgot i was watching acting.

Its some of the most natural, organic, realistic acting i can remember seeing. and that includes the KIDS.

Literally pitch perfect, and i almost boo-hooed in the theatre because by the end they felt like my family too. 

i was devastated for them, and quite triggered too.. have lived through a dictatorial regime where my uncle was disappeared, and apparently dropped in the ocean as well.

the cruelty we are capable of ..sigh."
Here,1ip0usd,19,And that kids is why you never vote for fascism
Here,1ip0usd,20,"The multiple endings did throw me off a little, I think the film could have ended with her looking at the video footage, but the choice to cast the lead actresses's mother legit tricked me into thinking it was just Fernanda Torres in good makeup. Again though, I think the endings did make the final section of the film feel longer.

That being said, the rest of it was excellently directed and edited, smoothly presented and expertly balanced real threat with a slice of life drama. Fernanda was good but I think she's outshone by Walter Salles who directs a film that could have come across messy, melodramatic or exploitative perfectly."
Babes,1jr0qw5,1,"I hadn‚Äôt thought about this movie in years and yet it has lived rent-free in my mind since I was 13. This may have been the movie to teach me about tropes, really, the way that it so effectively uses all the familiar conspiracy thriller beats a la ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù got branded into my young mind. I was actually quite surprised to see when I looked it up on Letterboxd that people don‚Äôt like this movie. I rewatched it this week and, while obviously not perfect, I still got quite a nostalgic kick out of it. 

Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker, a truly early 2000s cast, not to mention Leslie Bibb who is currently having her White Lotus moment. It‚Äôs actually insane to think this was 25 years ago, she still looks fantastic. I also love that this movie is mostly about Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen beefing. You‚Äôve got Coach and the Manhunter himself pulling these strings and they just give me such great ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù vibes. 

As far as similar conspiracy thrillers go, maybe this isn‚Äôt the most unique one. But it is so specific to a time and place. I really loved the moment when the plethora of models walk into the Skulls party and Higher by Creed starts playing, and they basically play the song in full with lyrics. It‚Äôs no mystery why 13-year-old me latched onto this. Plus you‚Äôve got some Papa Roach, some Collective Soul, some Fatboy Slim. This just really takes me back to a simpler time. 

There‚Äôs definitely a fantasy element that probably played really well to me back then too. The fantasy of one day being accepted into the elites, all your money problems and unsure future plans suddenly secured. I loved the touch that when he‚Äôs taking money out of the ATM it says, ‚Äú$20,019.43‚Äù or something, implying that he wouldn‚Äôt even have been able to take out twenty dollars in the first place. Not just the fantasy of security, but also the idea that a 19-year-old could pull one over on a 200 year old secret society that has endless resources and surveillance. 

Overall, even knowing this is just a carbon copy of so many movies before it and since, this still hits for me. The soundtrack, the cast, the tropes, they just bring me right back. It‚Äôs a 7/10 for me. A movie above any other!"
Babes,1jr0qw5,2,If y'all dont like this movie you can meet me in Liar's Hell
Babes,1jr0qw5,3,"It's wild. I was randomly thinking about this film the other day. I only ever saw it once and like another redditors said its sort of been in the place of simultaneously something that I hardly think about but also which lives rent free in my mind.

I was thinking that they don't really make films like this anymore."
Babes,1jr0qw5,4,This movie is such a male power fantasy.
Babes,1jr0qw5,5,This movie lived on Starz when I was a kid. I watched it a million times just because it was the best thing on at midnight. I always wanted it to be better than it actually was though.
Between the Temples,NA,NA,No comments found
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,1,I love how no one holds grudges in this world üòÇ Gru was almost killed by multiple people in that prison but they all just were chill with having a dance party together .
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,2,"Is it just me, or did this movie feel like they jammed two films together, and trimmed a bunch of scenes and plotlines for time?  

Agnes has trouble lying - this comes up a few times leading to the karate scene, and then is never mentioned again.  

Edith beats up the karate teacher, and then he never reappears and there is no repercussion to what she did or payoff regarding her fighting skill.  

Margo mentions leaving her friends (who we've never seen), is bullied in school (which we also don't see beyond when she gets back into the car), and then it never comes up again  there could have been something with the girl next door, but there doesn't seem to be anything beyond the girl coming over with the honey badger.  

Lucy has that whole hairdressing fiasco. Then she runs away from the woman in the store about halfway through the film... And then that's never brought up again. What happened to that woman?  

The bad guys spent literally the entire film slowly making their way to Gru, only to get there in the last 15 minutes and be instantly defeated. 

And the minions didn't interact with the main cast at all - you could play their Mega Minions parts on their own without the rest of the film and it would make just as much sense.   
They could probably even be removed from the final fight, since the bad guys had already pretty much been defeated at that point, and their plotline had wrapped with them retiring (making it very odd when they came out of retirement immediately after).

The film isn't necessarily bad, exactly. Just completely disjointed.  
It feels like maybe they had a coherent script that followed up on the kids and Lucy's plotlines, but then some producer pointed out that there weren't enough minions.  
So in order to keep the runtime at about 90 minutes, they wrote an unconnected minions superhero short, removed a bunch of scenes focusing on Gru's family from the film, and then gave the minions a one minute cameo crushing the villain at the end to try and tie everything together.

Addendum: Gru's name is Felonious Gru. The baby is called Gru Jr. So is the baby also called Felonious, or is it called Gru Gru?"
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,3,"I kinda wish the movie was more coherent between one and another plot points, Gru vs Maxime, Gru moved to the new neighborhood, Gru having a new Apprentice, Mega Minions, Gru and Lucy having a new bebe, I felt those plot points were disjointed, but on their own, most of them were entertaining."
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,4,"To those wondering, yes, Trey did come back to voice Bratt."
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,5,"It's certainly better than 3 and the first Minions at least. This pretty much has all of the same structural problems of the third - the detachment of Gru and the Minions (and the latter's subplot containing the bulk of the funniest material), too many characters to juggle, and an almost episodic feel. Simpsons logic makes the series consistently appealing to younger audiences, but does rob the chance to grow the series with families like Toy Story did.


With all of this being said, what was here was thankfully decently funny on both the A and B plot. Gru and Gru Jr. (Is that Felonius Jr.) have a fun rapport that reminded me of Jack Jack and Bob, but with an appropriate mean streak to it. The Mega Minions were in the film less than expected but earned some serious laughs when they were on screen (you know if you like these guys or not 6 films in). Poppy was a fun character who almost served as a foil to the girls, and Joey King was clearly having a blast going full Shelly from South Park.


Speaking of having a blast, there is a continuous take here with the Minions in the AVL office space that was stuffed with sight gags and very fun to watch - and followed by the very cute and funny retirement scene. Probably Illumination's best comedic animation work to date.


Will Ferrell was enjoyable if a bit underutilized. A victim of too many characters I suppose, he's definitely the least memorable of the villains of the 4. And having the older villains come back was a fun moment but does him no favours. Ah well, he still has his Oscar chances with ""Training A-Train"".


Also, lord knows the Skibidi Toilet crowd are gonna have a blast with that last song. Not sure if intentional or not, but a shrewd choice nonetheless.


I had a good time with this, as someone who has always enjoyed this series, but I am curious how many trips left to the well they have before diminishing returns. For now though, it's good to see Gru and Co back and who knows, by the time the make another of these I may have a Gru Jr. of my own to take, instead of being the ""guy who grew up with the series and thus is seeing the midnight show of it"" like everyone else in my crowd XD."
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,6,"Is no one concerned about the abject body horror that was the poor gas station employee getting turned into a cockroach man, seemingly still unfixed by the end of the movie"
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,7,"I thought most of the movie was decent enough but that ending was special, Everybody Wants To Rule The World is my favorite song of all time, I was not expecting a sing along of it at the end of this movie. 10/10 ending. Also I loved how they had Gru dressed up as Curt Smith from the original music video."
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,8,Why was the bad guy modeled on Macklemore?
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,9,Yes of course this movie was disjointed and the plot left many threads loose BUT the podcast joke was the funniest thing I‚Äôve heard all year and I‚Äôll never forget it
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,10,"The movie sucked real bad. There was no heart to it. The first 2 and even the third to an extent had some heart. This was so incredibly lifeless and plain boring. Bizarre plots that did nothing, Stephen Colberts character was completely pointless. As was Sophia Vegera who completely phoned it in. Disappointing"
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,11,It blows my mind that creators like Mike White (who wrote/directed all of The White Lotus) are also just casually pumping out scripts for Despicable Me 4. Never ceases to make me laugh at how weird this industry is.
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,12,"Did anyone else think Will Ferrell was surprisingly weak in this? Huge disappointment. 

However, I really loved the ""Everybody Wants To Rule The World"" scene at the end!"
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,13,Cant believe they did the exact same thing here as they did with DM3 and separated the minions and the family and basically just made two different intertwining movies. At least it worked better here than in the last one I thought but would have been better if it was a more coherent plot.
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,14,"I took my young children to it.

My smallest got scared of the old lady, my slightly older said he didn‚Äôt like it üòÖ

That said, it was an enjoyable experience and I enjoyed hearing Steve carrell and seeing the minions‚Äô antics. I don‚Äôt have any desire to see it again."
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,15,"At the end of the final musical dance member, as it cut to credits, some kid in the audience shouted ‚Äúthey ROCKED that song!‚Äù and it made all the adults laugh haha"

Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,17,...did this movie try to gaslight me into thinking it was perfectly acceptable for a middle aged father to develop a secret and special relationship with his neighbors 12 year old daughter and that's Good and Fine and they're the good guys?
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,18,The school was a big part of the plot for a reason I can see either a prequel (sequel : Minions 3) of Gru in school . Or sequel of Gru somehow becoming the new principal at the school or a new teacher with the other villians as maybe other teachers
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,19,The minions needed a chance to squish some roaches
Despicable Me 4,1duvov6,20,"i know this movie was made for kids but as an adult i couldn't fucking stand it!

the plot was everywhere, things seemed to happen for little to no reason other than to make the next plot point happen, things happened and were never mentioned again (the 2 girls in the karate class)

what a terrible film from a critical point of view. i'm sure it'll make bank though."

The Dambusters. Based on Operation Chastise where German Dams were destroyed in May 1943.

The Cockelshell Heroes. Based on Operation Frankton. In 1942, British marines sailed in Kayaks to Bordeaux and destroyed cargo shipping with limpet mines.

Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,1jr0qw5,1,"I hadn‚Äôt thought about this movie in years and yet it has lived rent-free in my mind since I was 13. This may have been the movie to teach me about tropes, really, the way that it so effectively uses all the familiar conspiracy thriller beats a la ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù got branded into my young mind. I was actually quite surprised to see when I looked it up on Letterboxd that people don‚Äôt like this movie. I rewatched it this week and, while obviously not perfect, I still got quite a nostalgic kick out of it. 

Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker, a truly early 2000s cast, not to mention Leslie Bibb who is currently having her White Lotus moment. It‚Äôs actually insane to think this was 25 years ago, she still looks fantastic. I also love that this movie is mostly about Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen beefing. You‚Äôve got Coach and the Manhunter himself pulling these strings and they just give me such great ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù vibes. 

As far as similar conspiracy thrillers go, maybe this isn‚Äôt the most unique one. But it is so specific to a time and place. I really loved the moment when the plethora of models walk into the Skulls party and Higher by Creed starts playing, and they basically play the song in full with lyrics. It‚Äôs no mystery why 13-year-old me latched onto this. Plus you‚Äôve got some Papa Roach, some Collective Soul, some Fatboy Slim. This just really takes me back to a simpler time. 

There‚Äôs definitely a fantasy element that probably played really well to me back then too. The fantasy of one day being accepted into the elites, all your money problems and unsure future plans suddenly secured. I loved the touch that when he‚Äôs taking money out of the ATM it says, ‚Äú$20,019.43‚Äù or something, implying that he wouldn‚Äôt even have been able to take out twenty dollars in the first place. Not just the fantasy of security, but also the idea that a 19-year-old could pull one over on a 200 year old secret society that has endless resources and surveillance. 

Overall, even knowing this is just a carbon copy of so many movies before it and since, this still hits for me. The soundtrack, the cast, the tropes, they just bring me right back. It‚Äôs a 7/10 for me. A movie above any other!"
Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,1jr0qw5,2,If y'all dont like this movie you can meet me in Liar's Hell
Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,1jr0qw5,3,"It's wild. I was randomly thinking about this film the other day. I only ever saw it once and like another redditors said its sort of been in the place of simultaneously something that I hardly think about but also which lives rent free in my mind.

I was thinking that they don't really make films like this anymore."
Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,1jr0qw5,4,This movie is such a male power fantasy.
Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,1jr0qw5,5,This movie lived on Starz when I was a kid. I watched it a million times just because it was the best thing on at midnight. I always wanted it to be better than it actually was though.

Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,1,"Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of the series, but ending the film on an in memorium montage to Eddie and Venom's relationship (of which half the montage are scenes from the movie we just watched) set to *Memories* by Maroon 5 was certainly a choice."
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,2,"In the first movie they established that it‚Äôs very hard for Human and Symbiote to find symbiosis, but in this one, they were just binding with people here and there. 

Also, Watching a montage of Venom and Eddie while Maroon 5‚Äôs Memories played is something I‚Äôd see on Twitter or TikTok made by a fan, not in Studio Produced movie."
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,3,Insane how they redid the convo with the bartender at the start but removed the line mentioning spiderman. Like come the fuck on lmao
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,4,"Was not expecting that the last dance was referring to Mrs. Chen 


WTF"
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,5,Why were the credits like 45 minutes long
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,6,"Baffling movie, to be honest. For a series that is so built around giving the people what they want, which is silly venom, it also strangely refuses to give you anything else. Knull is wasted to the point of parody leaving a gaping hole where a villain should be in this movie and even the easy to set up and knock down fun scenes like the Venomhorse and the trained military squad hunting a super alien are totally wasted. 

There have been some bad movies this year the likes of Madame Web, Rebel Moon, and The Crow, but this just felt sloppy. The MacGuffin is explained to you no less than ten times including an opening that is some of the laziest exposition drops I've seen in a while. There's a scientist who is too flippant about human life and a military guy with a bone to pick in the name of freedom, stop me if this all sounds too unique and fresh. Not to mention the setup getting to the scenes you want is so much hacked-in ADR and scientists explaining things to each other they should already know. Just an extremely tropey and done to death set of characters and circumstances, and what's it all leading to when Knull never interacts with a single damn character or even makes it to Earth? Wild that someone read this script and said yep, this is the one. 

The scenes you're here for are fun but often poorly shot and short lived. The opening scene in the bar where Venom turns Hardy into a flare bartender is a terrible show of editing. Hardy just feels tired this whole movie, and maybe that works for his circumstances, but it really felt like he was not as game for the fun part of this role as he was when he was climbing into lobster tanks. And once you get a solid action scene, being the underwater river chase and Venom jumping from animal to animal, the next scene is 20 minutes of unbroken hippie family. They were kind of fun and you get what the movie is going for there, but we are with them for so long and a lot of it is just awkward. 

Not that I expected much from this, and bless the actors involved, but this thing was written in crayon. Venom isn't even saying jokes anymore, it's just the sound of his voice singing David Bowie that we're supposed to find funny. The fun parts of this movie are serviceable, being his literal last dance and the symbiote gang at the end, but the spaces between are actual gibberish. Mrs. Chen looking like my next wife though. 4/10.

Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,7,So literally none of the theories happened and it was just a meh movie.
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,8,Sony continues to set the bar lower and lower for these movies. This was absolute garbage and another disservice to the characters it‚Äôs portraying
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,9,"It's wild how this is the worst Venom film...because it wasn't wacky enough.

Literally the one thing people loved about the last two was how balls-to-the-walls crazy they are.

They removed nearly all of the fun silliness (barring the dance scene).

I legit had a bad time and not a (so bad, it's good) time."
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,10,"Props to Tom Hardy for constantly looking like he's ill, physically uncomfortable and extremely constipated. I imagine that's just how you'd be if you were carrying around a large sentient blob."
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,11,"Is it just me who feels the blonde scientist was originally a villain? It's just the way that she's introduced and mentioned how much she cares about symbiotes is typical plot twist villain behavior, but no, the only thing she does the entire movie is become agony in the final 10 minutes while making a shitty paralel with her past that barely makes sense"
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,12,"One of the most jarring things about the trilogy is that it was from 2018-2024 but all of the events since Venom met Eddie, back to back only take up a year of Eddie‚Äôs life."
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,13,This is going to be the meme trilogy for a new generation
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,14,Remember when we thought Rhys Ifans was Knull or that his kid was Peter Parker. Yeahhhh about that.... They're just a family of hippies who are there to be area 51 conspiracy theorists and for the endangered child. At least the David Bowie sing-along was nice. 4/10
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,15,The poor bartender has been stuck at work / in post credit scenes across multiple movies / studios.
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,16,"Funny how all the usual nonsense rumors about Topher Grace Venom showing up and the kid being Peter Parker ended up being false.  
  
I'm surprised this ended being worse than Let there be Carnage, the pacing was all over the place, I laughed how they set up Mulligan to be meaningful only to get shredded 10 seconds later, same for the other Symbiotes, at least they kept Agony."
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,17,So a random dance with Mrs Chen was worth revealing the Codex? Ok
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,18,I want to forget about this trilogy as quickly as possible. They‚Äôre all terrible
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,19,"NGL, the credits of Venomized animals was far more interesting and visually unique than most of the movie."
Venom: The Last Dance,1gbjll4,20,Definitely the worst venom movie
